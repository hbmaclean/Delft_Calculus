## 

Trigonometric functions arise in periodic events such as acoustic and water waves and circular motions like Ferris wheels. When built in 2000, the London Eye was the largest Ferris wheel - with 32 closed cabins, 135 meters tall, and a thirty-minute rotation.

Trig functions are usually defined as the ratio of two sides of a triangle. Given an acute ange $\theta$:

-   its sine is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse
-   its cosine is the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse
-   its tangent is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the adjacent side, or $sin(\theta)/cos(\theta)$

Mnemonics: Sign makes a number its opposite. Cosigning is side-by-side.

A complete rotation contains 360 degrees, equal to $2\pi*r$. Therefore, $1r = \left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^\circ$ and $1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180r}$.

For a sector of a circle, the length of its arc is $s = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}*2\pi r = r * \theta$

A circle with $r=1$ is called the unit circle. A triangle within the circle with the radius as hypotenuse, then $\sin(\theta)$ can be found at the vertical axis and $cos(\theta)$ at the horizontal axis, and $tan(\theta)$ is the height of a vertical line tangent to the circle to the extended hypotenuse.

Thus we can calculate common angles easily with a quarter unit circle, from $0\pi$ to $\frac{1}{2}\pi$:

Ah, ok. We know $1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180}$, and thus for above, $30^\circ = \frac{30\pi}{180} = \frac{1}{6}\pi$. And knowing hypotenuse is 1, $\sin(\frac{1}{6}\pi) = \frac{opp}{1}$

Above has $\frac{1}{3}\pi = 60^\circ$, here is $\frac{2}{3}\pi$ - note that cosine is negative on the x-axis:

Another example, for $\frac{5}{6}\pi$ we make a *counterclockwise* turn with an angle of $\frac{5}{6}\pi$

And for $-\frac{2}{3}\pi$, we rotate clockwise on the unit circle

Since the tangent is the quotient of sine and cosine, it is defined for all values for which the cosine is non-zero; and its graph has vertical asymptotes at the zeros.

## Exercises

### Definitions

Suppose elevation of a London Eye cabin is a function of $h(t) = a + b * cos(c*t)$, with $a$, $b$, and $c$ constants ($c$ in radians) and $t$ a measure of time in minutes. **What are the constant values?**

We know, full rotation is $360^\circ$ and takes $t=30$, so rotation is $t * 12^\circ$.

As radians, we know $1^\circ = \frac{\pi}{180}$ and so $c = \frac{12\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{15}$ - rotation is $t*\frac{\pi}{15}$.

So we have:

$$
\begin{align}
h(0) &= 0\\
&= a + b * cos(\frac{\pi}{15}*0)\\
&= a + b * cos(0)\\
&= a + b * 1\\
&= a + b
\end{align}
$$

And logically,

$$
\begin{align}
h(15) &= 135\\
&= a + b * cos(\frac{\pi}{15} * 15)\\
&= a + b * cos(\pi)\\
&= a - b
\end{align}
$$

$a + b = 0$, and $a-b = 135$

It seems $\frac{135}{2} + -\frac{135}{2} * cos(\frac{\pi}{15} * t)$

**What is the speed of a cabin, in meters per second?**

Height of the Eye is 135 meters, which is $2r$ meters. Total distance is the circumference, or $2\pi r$, or $135\pi$ meters. So speed is $135\pi/30*60$.

### Sine and Cosine

In the following diagram, $h$ can be written as both $h = h_\alpha \sin(\alpha)$ and $h = h_\beta \sin(\beta)$

![](images/clipboard-912192002.png){width="333"}

**Given that, what are** $h_\alpha$ and $h_\beta$?

$sin(\alpha) = \frac{h}{b}$, thus $h = b * sin(\alpha)$

$sin(\beta) = \frac{h}{a}$, thus $h = a * sin(\beta)$

I thought $h_a$ syntax was a function, thus I first said $h_a = b * sin(\alpha)$ and $h_b = a * sin(\beta)$

With that wrong, I deduced correctly that $h_a = b$ and $h_b = a$.

**This leads to the sine rule given by** $\frac{a}{\sin(\alpha)} = ?$

$\frac{a}{sin(\alpha)} = \frac{b}{sin(\beta)}$

Recall Pythagorean theorem, $a^2 + b ^2 = c ^2$. In addition to calculating $h$, we can also derive the lengths of adjacent sides - the two portions of $c$: $b*cos(\alpha)$ and $a*cos(\beta)$, whose sum equals $c$.

![](images/clipboard-3103284203.png)

Given that, express $a^2$ in terms of $b$, $c$, and the angle $\alpha$.

$a^2 = (c - b*cos(\alpha)) ^2 + (b*sin(\alpha)) ^2$

# Rules of Calculation

Looking back to a right triangle within a unit circle, with hypotenuse of 1, we can see that the sum of squares of its sides is 1. This holds for all real $\theta$.

![](images/clipboard-2456798100.png){width="443"}

From the unit circle it is clear that sine and cosine are periodic functions. If we rotate through the circle, we will encounter the same $\theta$.

![](images/clipboard-1258920616.png){width="445"}

Thus, sine and cosine have a period of $2\pi$! This can be seen in their graphs as well:

Back to that triangle within a unit circle. The angle opposite $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta$, and for this angle the opposite- and adjacent sides are reversed, which shows that the cosine of one is equal to the sine of the other.

![](images/clipboard-3214103630.png){width="506"}

Now if we reflect that triangle along the x-axis, we can see that cosine of an angle and its reflection are equal ( $cos(-\theta) = cos(\theta)$ ); while sine of an angle and its reflection are opposite ( $-sin(\theta) = sin(-\theta)$ ).

![](images/clipboard-791406037.png){width="508"}

Graphs show that cosine is line-symmetric, and thus again even; and sine is point-symmetric in the origin, and thus odd:

## Addition Formula

Here we start again with a right triangle with hypotenuse of 1:

![](images/clipboard-3885289211.png)

Now we add an angle $\beta$ and two adjacent triangles:
