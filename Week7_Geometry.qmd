# Cartesian Coordinates

From Rene Descartes, we have the cartesian coordinate system in a plane, with perpendicular coordinate axes ($x$, $y$), point of origin at their intersection, and positive and negative coordinate points. The system is flexible in terms of orientation, units, and sign - all of which can be used advantageously. For example, while GPS coordinate axes run north-south and east-west, we might prefer orienting to a street plan - one axis parallel to streets and one to avenues.

This system was revolutionary in that it bridged two very different fields of mathematics - geometry and algebra.

# Vectors

Vectors have length and direction, but not a fixed starting point.

Vectors are used to describe flow - water, electricity, wind, people; force - such as gravitation.

Vector notation may include bold, underline, caret- or arrow above.

There is also a unique zero vector - with length zero and no direction. E.g., absence of wind on a still day.

Vectors can be added, even shifted such that they are head to toe for addition.

Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar increases the length accordingly. Multiplying by a negative scalar flips the direction, in addition to multiplying length.

## Calculating with Vectors

We can consider a line on a graph, say from origin to $(3,2)$, as a vector denoted by $\begin{pmatrix}3\\2\end{pmatrix}$, meaning from the starting point, move 3 to the right and 2 up. Since vectors do not have fixed starting points, this is equal to the vector from $(1,1)$ to $(4,3)$, or from $(-1,1)$ to $(2,3)$.

In general a vector from $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$ is the vector with $c-a$ as the first component and $d-b$ as the second component.

The length, or norm, of a vector $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ is $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

To add two vectors, we sum them component-wise: $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a+c\\b+d\end{pmatrix}$

Multiplying a vector by a scalar is also component-wise: $k\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}ka\\kb\end{pmatrix}$

Multiplication holds for negative scalars, which as explained earlier, flips the direction.

## The Dot Product

When adding two vectors, the sum can be obtained geometrically by placing one after another.

Multiplying a vector by a scalar also has geometric meaning, as it simply multiplies the length of the arrow.

Multiplying two vectors does NOT have geometric meaning. To do so, we use the "dot" product, which in general takes the form $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix} = ac + bd$. The result is a scalar, not another vector.

The dot product relates to geometry as follows: Given two vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, and the angle between them $\alpha$, then their dot product equals the product of their lengths times $cos(\alpha)$ - e.g., $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = ||\vec{v}||*||\vec{w}||*cos(\alpha)$

We can use this property to find the angle between any two vectors:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{v} &= \begin{pmatrix}1\\2\end{pmatrix} \\
\vec{w} &= \begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix} \\
cos(\alpha) &= \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||*||\vec{w}||} \\
&= \frac{5}{\sqrt{5}\sqrt{10}}
\end{align}
$$

In this case, $cos(\alpha)$ can be simplified to $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}$, which we know to be the cosine of $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

In any case, the dot product is revealing:

-   If the dot product is negative, the cosine of the angle is negative - meaning the angle is larger than $\frac{\pi}{2}$, and obtuse.
-   If the dot product is positive, so is the cosine; and thus the angle is less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and acute.
-   If the dot product is zero, and the vector lengths are non-zero, then the cosine of the angle is 0, meaning the angle is $\frac{pi}{2}$ and right.

### Rules of Calculation

Order does not matter: $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = \vec{w} \cdot \vec{v}$.

For any three vectors, $\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} + \vec{w}) = \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{w}$

For any two vectors and scalar, $(c\vec{v}) \cdot \vec{w} = \vec{v} \cdot (c\vec{w}) = c(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w})$

For any vector, if $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v} = 0$ then $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\end{pmatrix}$

Note:

-   It is possible that $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 0$ with neither vector equal to the zero vector
-   Dot product of three vectors is not defined
-   Square of a vector is not defined, always write $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}$

### Angle Between Two Vectors

The angle formula says that the cosine of the angle between two vectors equals their dot product over the product of their lengths:

$$
cos(\alpha) = \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||*||\vec{w}||}
$$

And we know that a straight angle corresponds to a zero-dot product, and thus $cos(0) = 90^\circ$.

To prove the formula we use the definition of cosine as the quotient of the length of the adjacent side over the length of the hypotenuse *in a right triangle*.

To acquire a right triangle, we can draw a line perpendicular to one of the vectors - an orthogonal projection of one vector onto another:

![](images/clipboard-1394278850.png){width="241"}

To determine the cosine, we need to determine the lengths of the sides, for which we first need to identify the new point $P$.

To determine $P$, we look at its properties:

-   First, $\vec{OP}$ points in the same direction as $\vec{v}$, and so is a multiple of $\vec{v}$: $\vec{OP} = c\vec{v}$
-   $\vec{PW}$ is perpendicular to $\vec{v}$, meaning that $\vec{PW}\cdot\vec{v} = 0$
-   Now the new vector equals the hypotenuse vector minus the origin to the new point: $\vec{PW} = \vec{OW} - \vec{OP}$

This gives us:

$$
\begin{align}
(\vec{w} - c\vec{v})\cdot\vec{v} &= 0 \\
\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v} - c\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} &= 0 \\
\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v} &= c\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} \\
c &= \left(\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v}\right)/\left(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}\right)\\\\
\text{Circling back to the first bullet point:}\\
\vec{OP} &= c\vec{v} \\
&= ((\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v}/(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v})) * \vec{v}
\end{align}
$$For a working example, consider $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix}$.

Then the projection of $\vec{w}$ onto $\vec{v}$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
p &= ((\vec{w}\cdot\vec{v})/(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}))*\vec{v} \\
&= \left( \begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}\right) /
   \left( \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}\right) *\vec{v} \\
&= \left(3*1 + 1*1\right)/\left(1*1 + 1*1\right)*\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \frac{4}{2}*\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix} \\
&= 2*\begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix} \\
&= \begin{pmatrix}2\\2\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Now for the angle between the original vectors, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
cos(\alpha) &= \frac{||\vec{p}||}{||\vec{w}||} \\
&= \frac{||\frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}}\vec{v}||}{||\vec{w}||} \\
&= \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}}\left(\frac{||\vec{v}||}{||\vec{w}||}\right) \\
&= \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||^2}\left(\frac{||\vec{v}||}{||\vec{w}||}\right)
\end{align}
$$

Here is a visual example - trying to best position a TV in a room:

|  |  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ![](images/clipboard-2193332596.png){width="426"} | $$
\begin{align}
\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} &= (-1.5*-0.5) + (1.5*1.5) = 3 \\\\
||\vec{v}|| &= \sqrt{(-1.5)^2 + 1.5^2} \Rightarrow \sqrt{4.5} \\\\
||\vec{w}|| &= \sqrt{(-0.5)^2 + 1.5^2} \Rightarrow \sqrt{2.5} \\\\
cos(\alpha) &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{4.5}\sqrt{2.5}}
= \frac{3}{\sqrt{4.5*2.5}}
= \frac{3}{\sqrt{11.25}} \\
&= \frac{3}{\sqrt{\frac{45}{4}}}
= \frac{3}{\frac{\sqrt{45}}{\sqrt{4}}}
= \frac{3}{\frac{\sqrt{45}}{2}}
= \frac{6}{\sqrt{45}}
= \frac{6}{3\sqrt{5}}
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}
\end{align}
$$ |

# Curves and Equations

A circle is the set of all points with the same distance from the center. The distance is the radius ($r$), and we'll call the center $(a,b)$, then we have:

$$
\begin{align}
r &= \left|\left|\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}\right|\right| \\\\
&= \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}
\end{align}
$$In the standard form of a formula for a circle, $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, the center ($(a,b)$) and radius are immediately apparent; and thus thus try to avoid expanding the formula.

However, $2x^2 -4x + 2y^2 + 8y + 1 = 0$ is also a circle! It contains only terms of the form $x^2$, $y^2$, $x$, $y$, and a constant; and the coefficient for $x^2$ and $y^2$ is identical. This formula we want to rewrite in standard form by completing the square. We tackle the $x$ and $y$ terms separately.

First, we want to rewrite $2x^2 - 4x$ as $2(x-a)^2 + c$ for some $a$ and $c$. If we expand, we get $2x^2 -4ax + 2a^2 + c$, so $-4x = -4ax$, and $a=1$. Then $c$ must negate $2a^2$, and $a=1$, so $c=-2$. Thus we can replace $2x^2-4x$ with $2(x-1)^2 -2$.

Now we rewrite $2y^2 + 8y$ as $2(y-a)^2 +c$. Expanding again gives $2y^2 - 4ay + 2a^2 + c$, so $8y = -4ay$, and $a = -2$. Then $c$ must negate $2a^2$, so $c=-8$. Thus we have $2(y+2)^2 - 8$.

Thus we find that $2x^2 - 4x + 2y^2 + 8y + 1 = 2(x-1)^2 + 2(y+2)^2 - 9$. (NOTE: $-9$ is $-2$ for $x$; $-8$ for $y$; and $+1$ for the original constant.)

Validate!

```{r}
x<-7; y<-pi; 2*x^2 - 4*x + 2*y^2 + 8*y + 1; 2*(x-1)^2 + 2*(y+2)^2 - 9
```

Finally we can rewrite the formula as $(x-1)^2 + (y+2)^2 = \frac{9}{2}$, making clear the center $(1,-2)$ and radius $\sqrt{\frac{9}{2}}$.

## Equations for a Line

Vertical lines are described by $x=c$ for some constant $c$. All other lines can be described as $y = ax+b$.

The following method provides a unified description of all lines, and generalizes to higher dimensions - such as the equation of a plane in three dimensions.

For any given line, we first determine a perpendicular vector $n = (a,b)$, called the normal vector.

Next we take the point of intersection, $P$. Then another point $(x,y)$ is on the line if the vector $(x,y)-P$ points in the direction of the line. Since $n$ is perpendicular, the dot-product of $n$ and $(x,y)-P$ equals zero. We can also conclude that the dot product of $n$ with $(x,y)$ equals the dot product with $P$. Writing $n=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ and $n \cdot P = c$ and expanding the equation gives the standard formula for the line, $ax + by = n \cdot P = c$.

For example, for the vertical line through $(3,2)$, the normal vector is $(1,0)$, so $a=1$ and $b=0$. Thus we have $1x+0y=c$. To determine $c$, we take one point on the line - may as well take the given $(3,2)$ - and plug in for $1*3 + 0*2 = 3$, which is exactly the dot product of $(3,2)$ with $(1,0)$.

A more interesting line is through $(2,1)$ and $(4,-2)$. The direction of the line is from $(4,-2)$ to $(2,1)$, so $(2,-3)$. We obtain the normal vector by swapping the components and multiplying one of them by $-1$, giving $(3,2)$. Indeed, vector $(3,2)$ is perpendicular to $(2,-3)$ as their dot product is $6-6=0$. Thus the equation for the line is $3x + 2y = c$. We again obtain $c$ by plugging in a point, say $(2,1)$, and so $c=3*2+2*1=8$. Thus we have $3x+2y-8$.

In summary:

$$
\begin{align}
&(x,y) \text{ is on the line if: }\\
&n \perp \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} - P \\\\
&n \cdot \left(\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} - P\right) = 0 \\\\
&n \cdot \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} = n \cdot P \\\\
&n = \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix} \\\\
&n \cdot P = c \\\\
&\text{Therefore: } \\
&ax + by = c
\end{align}
$$

## Circles and their Tangents

A line is tangent to a circle if it intersects in exactly one point.

Further, for any point $P$ on a circle with center $C$, the line tangent to $P$ is orthogonal to vector $\vec{CP}$.

# Parameterization

A circle can be described sufficiently given its center and radius, say center is $(4,3)$ and radius is $2$.

Given that, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to check if any point is on the circle: $(x-4)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 2^2$. This is known as an implicit description of the circle.

A third description is parameterization, and it is considered explicit. If we were to travel the circumference once and consider the $x,y$ coordinates functions of time, with $x(t) = 4 - 2cos(t)$ and $y(t) = 3 + 2sin(t)$ for $0 \le t \lt 2\pi$.

Rules of parameterization: The entire curve must be covered; and only once, with the possible exception of start-and-endpoint of a circle.

Now consider a line segment from $A=(2,4)$ to $B=(5,-1)$. If we traverse the line over time $(0,1)$, then if at time $t$ we are at point $P$, we know $\vec{AP} = t\vec{AB} = \begin{pmatrix}3t\\-5t\end{pmatrix}$, and therefore $P = (2+3t, 4-5t)$; and we have $x(t) = 2 + 3t$ and $y(t) = 4 - 5t$ for $0 \le t \le 1$.

In summary:

**Circles** - a circle with center $(a,b)$ and radius $r$ can be parameterized as:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&a+r\cos(t)\\ y(t)&=&b+r\sin(t)\end{array}\right.\
\text{with } 0 \le t \le 2\pi
$$

**Lines** - A line through $(a,b)$ with direction given by $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}v_x\\v_y\end{pmatrix}$ can be parameterized as:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&a+v_x\,t\\ y(t)&=&b+v_y\,t\end{array}\right.\
\text{with } -\infty \le t \le \infty \\\\
$$

**Line Segments** - A line segment from $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$ can be parameterized as:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&a+(c-a)t\\ y(t)&=&b+(d-b)t\end{array}\right.\
\text{with } 0 \le t \le 1
$$

**Graphs of Functions** - The graph of a function $f$ with $x$ ranging from $a$ to $b$ can be parameterized as:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&t\\ y(t)&=&f(t)\end{array}\right.\
\text{with } a \le t \le b
$$

## Velocity and Acceleration

Velocity and acceleration are important concepts in physics, and parameterization can be used to determine them.

As an example, we consider palletizers - robotic arms that stack boxes onto pallets. The stacking should be done as fast as possible; but the speed cannot be arbitrarily high, and the acceleration should not be higher than object (e.g. eggs!) can handle. Optimizing can be an interesting and challenging problem.

The first question is, if you know the position of an object as a function of time, how do you find speed and acceleration?

Rather than speed, we look at velocity - speed plus direction - which can be described by a vector, which points in the direction of motion, and has norm equal to the speed. I.e., if the velocity vector is known, we can take the norm as speed. So how do we determine the velocity vector?

First, assume our object is moving at a constant speed along a straight line; and at time $t$, the object is at position $A$, and some time $\Delta t$ later, it is at position $B$. The change of position is given by the displacement vector $\vec{AB}$, and velocity is defined as $\frac{\vec{AB}}{\Delta t}$.

But what if the path is not straight and the speed not constant? The motion of the object gives a parameterization of the path: At some time $t$, the object is at $A = (x(t), y(t))$. Some time later, the object is at $B = (x(t + \Delta t), y(t + \Delta t))$. The change in position is then given by the vector of the difference of those two components:

$$
\vec{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)\\y(t+\Delta t) - y(t)\end{pmatrix}
$$

And the average velocity is given as that vector over change in time:

$$
\vec{v_{av}} = \frac{\vec{AB}}{\Delta t}
$$

But the average velocity is an approximation. What is the exact velocity at time $t$? The smaller we take $\Delta t$, the closer the approximation. When we take the limit of $\Delta t$ to $0$, the average velocity vector becomes the velocity vector of the object at point $A$. Furthermore, at the limit, the average velocity vector is tangent to the path at $A$ - which is intuitive, as the object travels in the direction of the path.

So for velocity at time $t$, we have:

$$
\begin{align}
\vec{v}(t) &= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t}\begin{pmatrix}x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)\\y(t+\Delta t) - y(t)\end{pmatrix} \\\\
&= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{x(t+\Delta t)-x(t)}{\Delta t}\\
\frac{y(t+\Delta t)-y(t)}{\Delta t}\end{pmatrix}
\text{ (Scalar } \frac{1}{\Delta t} \text{ moved into vector)}\\\\
&= \begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\end{pmatrix} \text{ (Above quotients ARE the derivatives!)}
\end{align}
$$

This means, if the position is known as a function of time, the velocity vector contains the derivatives of the position vector. Speed at $t$ is then the norm of that vector - the square root of the sum of derivatives squared. Acceleration at $t$ can be calculated by taking the time derivative of the velocity vector, or as the second derivative of the position vector.

Velocity, speed, and acceleration:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Velocity at } t:\\
\vec{v}(t) &= \begin{pmatrix}x'(t)\\y'(t)\end{pmatrix} \\\\
\text{Speed at } t:\\
||\vec{v}(t)|| &= \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2} \\\\
\text{Acceleration at } t:\\
\vec{a}(t) &= \vec{v'}(t) = \begin{pmatrix}x''(t)\\y''(t)\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

It is important to note that the acceleration vector describes the rate of change of the speed of an object, and any change in direction. And it is possible for an object to move at constant speed with non-zero acceleration!? An example is a swing chair ride. During the ride, chairs have a constant speed. However, ropes pull the chairs inward - there is an effective horizontal force on the chairs. This means the chairs are accelerating, even though the speed is constant!

# Exercises

1.  Consider a rectangle with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, where we know coordinates $A = (-2, -1)$, $B = (5, -1)$, and $C = (5,3)$. What are the coordinates of $D$?

    $(-2, 3)$

2.  Consider equilateral triangle with $A = (2,1)$, $B = (2, 7)$, and $C$ - what are its coordinates?

    $AB = 7-6 = 6$, so $C = (1+3, ?)$. Hint says height of equilateral triangle is $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}*base$, so $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}*6 = 5.196152$ (Wrong?!) Ah, plus 2 offset...

    Cartesian length formula is $\sqrt{\left((x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\right)}$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \sqrt{\left((x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2\right)} &= \sqrt{\left((x-2)^2 + (4-1)^2\right)} = 6 \\
    &= \sqrt{\left((x-2)^2 + 9\right)} = 6 \\
    &= (x-2)^2 = 27 \\
    &= x-2 = \sqrt{27} \\
    &= x = \sqrt{27}+2
    \end{align}
    $$

3.  Suppose we have $A = (5,3)$, $B = (2,3)$, and $C = (-1, 1)$, and we shift the origin down 1, right 7. What are the new coordinates of $A$? Instinctively guessed $(12,2)$, but no - shifting origin does the reverse - $(-2, 4)$.

4.  Suppose instead we rotate the original coordinate system $90^\circ$ clockwise. What are new coordinates of $B$ (originally, $(2,3)$)?

    Guessed $(-2,3)$, thinking we rotate axes but not point. (Wrong)

    Then $(2, -3)$, thinking we rotate whole thing. (Wrong)

    Oops, started with $(3,2)$, not $(2,3)$. So, like second guess, $(3, -2)$. (Wrong)

    Like first guess, $(-3, 2)$. (Correct - so, rotate axes, not point.)

5.  Suppose instead we rotate the original coordinate system $45^\circ$ counter-clockwise. What are the new coordinates of $C$ (originally, $(-1, 1)$)?

    With pencil and paper, $-45^\circ$ should put the point ON the y-axis, thus $y=0$. Distance from origin must remain unchanged, $\sqrt{2}$, so $x = \sqrt{2}$

6.  Distance between $(-2,3)$ and $(4, -1)$.

    $\sqrt{ 6^2 + 4^2 }$

7.  Given a line at $y=3$, a point $P$ on that line at $(7,3)$, and another point $Q$ at $(x, 3)$ such that distance from $Q$ to origin equals $QP$.

    Hmmm.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    Q0 &= \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2+9} \\
    QP &= \sqrt{(7-x)^2 + (3-3)^2} = \sqrt{(7-x)^2} \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2+9} = \sqrt{(7-x)^2} \\
    &\Rightarrow x^2 + 9 = 49 -14x + x^2 \\
    &\Rightarrow 14x = 40 \\
    &\Rightarrow x = \frac{20}{7} \\
    \text{Validate:} \\
    \sqrt{ \left(\frac{20}{7}\right)^2 + 9 } &= 4.142857 \\
    \sqrt{\left(7-\frac{20}{7}\right)^2} &= 4.142857
    \end{align}
    $$

    $Q0 = \sqrt{(x-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 9}$ and $QP = \sqrt{(7-x)^2 + (3-3)^2} = \sqrt{(7-x)^2}$

8.  What best describes triangle with $A = (2, -1)$, $B = (6, 1)$, and $C = (0, 8)$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    AC &= \sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (8--1)^2} = 9.219544 \\
    AB &= \sqrt{(6-2)^2 + (1--1)^2} = 4.472136 \\
    BC &= \sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (8-1)^2} = 9.219544 \\
    AC &= BC \Rightarrow \text{thus, isosceles}
    \end{align}
    $$

9.  Which can be described as vectors?

    i.  Cash in wallet \[ NO - no direction. No? Income, expenditures? \]
    ii. Electric field \[ YES \]
    iii. Temperature \[ NO - no direction. No? Up, down? \]
    iv. Slope of a mountain \[ YES...\]

10. Let $\hat{v}$ and $\hat{w}$ be two arbitrary vectors. Draw $\vec{v}$, $\vec{w}$, and their sum $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$ with their starting points at the origin. Consider the quadrilateral with the endpoints of these three vectors and the origin as vertices. What kind of quadrilateral is this?

    i.  square
    ii. rectangle
    iii. rhombus \[ Tried second, wrong (only true if $\hat{v}$ and $\hat{w}$ have same length \]
    iv. parallelogram \[ Tried third, correct \]
    v.  kite \[ Tried first, wrong \]
    vi. trapezoid

    Does it NOT matter how the vectors are drawn? What if all are drawn on the y-axis, say - then it's just a line? Or if two are drawn in opposite directions?

11. $\vec{v}$ starts at $(-1,2)$ and ends at $(3,4)$. What are its components?

    $\begin{pmatrix}4\\2\end{pmatrix}$

12. Provide the length of $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}-2\\3\end{pmatrix}$

    $\sqrt{ (-2)^2 + 3^2 } = \sqrt{13} = 3.605551$

13. Given $\vec{u} = \begin{pmatrix}-2\\1\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}1\\4\end{pmatrix}$, calculate $\vec{w} = 3\vec{u} - 2\vec{v}$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    3\begin{pmatrix}-2\\1\end{pmatrix} - 2\begin{pmatrix}1\\4\end{pmatrix}
    &= \begin{pmatrix}-6\\3\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}2\\8\end{pmatrix} \\
    &= \begin{pmatrix}-8\\-5\end{pmatrix}
    \end{align}
    $$

14. Dot product of $\begin{pmatrix}3\\5\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}2\\-3\end{pmatrix}$

    $6 + -15 = -9$

    And thus angle is obtuse

15. Suppose $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{3}$, $||\vec{w}|| = \sqrt{6}$, and $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 3$. What is the angle in radians between $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    cos(\alpha) &= \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||*||\vec{w}||} \\
    &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}} \\
    &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{18}} \\
    &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{9*2}} \\
    &= \frac{3}{3\sqrt{2}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} * \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
    &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

    $$

    From the unit circle, this is $\frac{\pi}{4}$

16. Consider triangle with $A = (1,1)$, $B = (4,2)$, and $C = (-1, 7)$. Which is true?

    i.  $ABC$ is a right triangle, with right angle at $A$
    ii. $ABC$ is a right triangle, with right angle at $B$
    iii. $ABC$ is a right triangle, with right angle at $C$
    iv. $ABC$ is not a right triangle

    $$
    \begin{align}
    ||AB|| &= \sqrt{(4-1)^2 + (2-1)^2} = \sqrt{10} \\
    ||AC|| &= \sqrt{(-1-1)^2 + (7-1)^2} = \sqrt{40} \\
    ||BC|| &= \sqrt{(4--1)^2 + (2-7)^2} = \sqrt{50} \\ 
    \end{align}
    $$

    Clearly, $||AB||^2 + ||AC||^2 = ||BC||^2$; $BC$ is the hypotenuse and right angle is at $A$.

17. Suppose $||\vec{v}|| = 1$, $||\vec{w}|| = 4$, and $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = 2$.

    i.  Find $\vec{w} \cdot (-3\vec{v} + \vec{w})$

        $$
        \begin{align}
        \vec{w} \cdot (-3\vec{v} + \vec{w}) &= \vec{w} \cdot -3\vec{v} + \vec{w} \cdot \vec{w} \\
        &= -3\left(\vec{w} \cdot \vec{v}\right) + \begin{pmatrix}2\\\sqrt{12}\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}2\\\sqrt{12}\end{pmatrix} \\
        &= -3\left(\begin{pmatrix}2\\\sqrt{12}\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}\right) + 16 \\
        &= -3*2 + 16 = 10
        \end{align}
        $$

    ii. Find $||\vec{v} - \vec{w}||$

        $$
        \begin{align}
        ||\vec{v} - \vec{w}|| &= \sqrt{(\vec{v}-\vec{w})\cdot(\vec{v}-\vec{w})} \\
        &= \sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + \vec{w}\cdot\vec{w}} \\
        &= \sqrt{||\vec{v}||^2 - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + ||\vec{w}||^2 } \\
        &= \sqrt{1^2 - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + 4^2} \\
        &= \sqrt{17 - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} }
        \end{align}
        $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    ||\vec{v}|| &= 1 \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{(v_a)^2 + (v_b)^2} = 1 \\
    &\Rightarrow (v_a)^2 + (v_b)^2 = 1 \\\\
    ||\vec{w}|| &= 4 \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{(w_a)^2 + (w_b)^2} = 4 \\
    &\Rightarrow (w_a)^2 + (w_b)^2 = 16 \\\\
    \begin{pmatrix}v_a\\v_b\end{pmatrix} &\cdot \begin{pmatrix}w_a\\w_b\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\
    &\Rightarrow v_a*w_a + v_b*w_b = 2 \\\\
    \text{*Perhaps*:}\\
    \vec{v} &= \begin{pmatrix}\pm1\\0\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow ||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{1} \\
    \vec{w} &= \begin{pmatrix}\pm2\\\sqrt{12}\end{pmatrix} \Rightarrow ||\vec{w}|| = \sqrt{16} = 4 \\
    ||v - w|| &= \sqrt{(\vec{v}-\vec{w})\cdot(\vec{v}-\vec{w})} \\
    &= \sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + \vec{w}\cdot\vec{w}} \\
    &= \sqrt{||\vec{v}||^2 - 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + ||\vec{w}||^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{1^2 - 2*2 + 4^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{13} \text{ (Correct!)}
    \end{align}
    $$

18. Find angle between $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, given $||\vec{v}|| = 5$, $||\vec{w}|| = 12$, and $||\vec{v} + \vec{w}|| = 13$.

    Hmm. Dot is $ac + bd$. Plus is $\begin{pmatrix}a+c\\b+d\end{pmatrix}$. Norm/length is $||\sqrt{(a-c)^2 + (b-d)^2}||$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    ||\vec{v}|| &= 5 \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{(v_a)^2 + (v_b)^2} &= 5 \\
    &\Rightarrow (v_a)^2 + (v_b)^2 &= 25 \\
    &\Rightarrow (\pm5,0), (\pm4,\pm3), ...\\\\
    ||\vec{w}|| &= 12 \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{(w_a)^2 + (w_b)^2} &= 12 \\
    &\Rightarrow (w_a)^2 + (w_b)^2 &= 144 \\
    &\Rightarrow (\pm12,0), ... \\\\
    ||\begin{pmatrix}v_a\\v_b\end{pmatrix} &+ \begin{pmatrix}w_a\\w_b\end{pmatrix}|| = 13 \\
    &\Rightarrow \sqrt{(w_a - v_a)^2 + (w_b - v_b)^2} &= 13 \\
    &\Rightarrow (w_a - v_a)^2 + (w_b - v_b)^2 &= 169 \\\\
    \text{Perhaps?}\\
    \vec{w} &= \begin{pmatrix}\pm12\\0\end{pmatrix} \\
    \vec{v} &= \begin{pmatrix}0\\\pm5\end{pmatrix} \\
    &\Rightarrow \begin{pmatrix}\pm12\\0\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}0\\\pm5\end{pmatrix} &= 0 \\\\
    cos(\alpha) &= \frac{\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w}}{||\vec{v}||*||\vec{w}||} \\
    &= \frac{0}{5*12} = 0 \\
    \text{If so, } cos(90) = 0 \Rightarrow 90 * \frac{\pi}{180}
    \end{align}
    $$

    I was correct, but the explanation is useful:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    13 &= ||v + w|| \\
    &= \sqrt{(\vec{v}+\vec{w})\cdot(\vec{v}+\vec{w})} \\
    &= \sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v} + 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + \vec{w}\cdot\vec{w}} \\
    &= \sqrt{||\vec{v}||^2 + 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + ||\vec{w}||^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{5^2 + 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} + 12^2} \\
    &= \sqrt{169 + 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}} \\\\
    13 &= \sqrt{169+2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}\\
    169 &= 169+2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} \\
    0 &= 2\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} 
    \end{align}
    $$

19. What is the angle between $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix}3\\2\end{pmatrix}$, in degrees to the nearest integer.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    ||\vec{v}|| &= \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5} \\
    ||\vec{w}|| &= \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} \\
    \vec{v}\cdot\vec{w} &= (-1*3) + (2*2) = 1 \\
    cos(\alpha) &= \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{||v||*||w||} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}\sqrt{13}} \\
    \alpha &= arccos(\frac{1}{\sqrt{65}}) * (180/pi) \approx 82.875^\circ
    \end{align}
    $$

20. Calculate the projection of $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}2\\3\end{pmatrix}$ onto $\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    p &= \left( \begin{pmatrix}2\\3\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}\right) /
    \left( \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix}\right) *
    \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix} \\
    &= ((2*-1)+(3*2))/(-1^2 + 2^2) * \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix} \\
    &= \frac{4}{5} * \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\end{pmatrix} \\
    &= \begin{pmatrix}-\frac{4}{5}\\\frac{8}{5}\end{pmatrix}
    \end{align}
    $$

21. The vertices of a regular hexagon are at $(cos(60k), sin(60k)$ for $k = 0,1,...,5$. Calculate the angle in the diagram, in degrees to the nearest integer:

    ![](images/clipboard-574788923.png){width="136"}

    From the diagram and knowing that interior angles are $120^\circ$, it seemed clear enough that the shaded area is one fourth of one angle - so I just said $30^\circ$ (correct)

22. The physical concept of work is defined as the size of force times the displacement of an object in the direction of the force. The latter concept of directional displacement is known as scalar projection: the length of the displacement vector on the force vector, with a sign indicating whether the angle between the vectors is acute (+) or obtuse (-). The scalar projection equals $\left(\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}\right)/\left(||\vec{w}||\right)$.

    Consider an object moving from $(2,4)$ to $(3,-4)$ while a force $F = \begin{pmatrix}3\\4\end{pmatrix}$ acts on it. What is the scalar projection of the displacement on $F$?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    (2,4) \rightarrow (3,-4) &= \begin{pmatrix}1\\-8\end{pmatrix} \\
    \frac{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}}{||\vec{w}||} &= \left( \begin{pmatrix}1\\-8\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}3\\4\end{pmatrix} \right / \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \\
    &= \frac{-29}{5}
    \end{align}
    $$

23. Consider circle with center $(-1,2)$ with point $(1,-1)$. Give $a$, $b$, and $r$ for $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \sqrt{(1--1)^2 + (-1-2)^2} &= \sqrt{4+9} = \sqrt{13} \\
    a &= -1 \\
    b &= 2 \\
    r &= \sqrt{13}
    \end{align}
    $$

24. $2x^2 + 6x + 2y^2 - 4y = -6$ defines a circle. Determine its radius and center.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    2x^2 + 6x &= 2(x-a)^2 + c = 2x^2 -4ax + 2a^2 + c \\
    &\Rightarrow a = -1.5, c = -4.5 \\
    2y^2 - 4y &= 2(y-a)^2 + c = 2y^2 -4ay + 2a^2 + c \\
    &\Rightarrow a = 1, c = -2\\\\
    2x^2 + 6x + 2y^2 - 4y + 6 &= 2(x+1.5)^2 + 2(y-1)^2 -0.5 \\
    &= (x+1.5)^2 + (y-1)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \\\\
    \text{Thus, center } &= (-1.5, 1) \text{ and radius } = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}}
    \end{align}
    $$

25. A circle with center $(1,0)$ and radius $\sqrt{2}$ twice intersects another circle with center $(-2,1)$ and radius $2$. Identify the higher intersection point.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Circle #1} \\
    (x-1)^2 + (y-0)^2 &= \sqrt{2}^2 = 2\\
    \text{Circle #2} \\
    (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 &= 2^2 = 4\\\\
    (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 &= ((x-1)^2 + y^2)^2 \\
    (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 &= (x-1)^4 + 2y^2(x-1)^2 + y^4 \\
    (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 &= (x-1)^4 + 2y^2(x^2 -2x + 1) + y^4 \\
    x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 -2y + 1 &= x^4 -4x^3 + 6x^2 -4x + 1 + 2x^2y^2 -4xy^2 + 2y^2 + y^4 \\\\
    x^4 -4x^3 + 5x^2 -8x + y^4 + y^2 + 2y -4 + 4xy^2 -2x^2y^2 &= 0 \Rightarrow (0,1)! \\
    (x-1)^4 -x^2 -4x + y^4 + (y+1)^2 -6 + 4xy^2 -2x^2y^2\\
    (x-1)^4 -x^2 -4x + y^4 + (y+1)^2 -6 + 2y^2(2x -x^2) \\
    (x-1)^4 - (x+2)^2 + y^4 + (y+1)^2 + 2y^2(2x -x^2) -2 \\
    (x-1)^4 - (x+2)^2 + y^4 + (y+1)^2 - 2y^2(x^2 -2x) -2 \\
    (x-1)^4 - (x+2)^2 + y^4 + (y+1)^2 - 2y^2(x-1)^2 + 2y^2 - 2 \\
    \end{align}
    $$

26. Give the (most obvious) normal vector for $2x+3y=7$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Two points}&: (2,1), (5,-1) \\
    \text{Direction}&: (5-2, -1 -1) = (3,-2) \\
    \text{Perpendicular}&: (2,3) \\
    \end{align}
    $$

27. Determine equation for line through $(2,3)$ and $(1,5)$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Two points}&: (1,5),(2,3) \\
    \text{Direction}&: (2-1,3-5) = (1,-2) \\
    \text{Perpendicular}&: (2,1) \\
    \text{Formula}&: 2x + 1y = c \\
    \text{Plug in}&: 2*2 + 1*3 = 7 \\
    \text{Formula}&: 2x + 1y - 7
    \end{align}
    $$

28. Consider circle with center $(0,0)$ and radius $2$; with a line defined by $3x -y + 2$, which intersects the circle at $(0,2)$ and one other point. What is that other point?

    Hmm. I think that means, $x$ and $y$ satisfy the line formula AND fit the radius formula. So, $3x - y + 2 = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 -4 = 0$. So,

    $$
    \begin{align}
    0 &= 3x -y + x^2 + y^2 +2 -4 \\
    0 &= x^2 + 3x + y^2 -y -2 \\
    2 &= (x+1)(x+2) + (y-2)(y+1) \\
    \end{align}
    $$

    I got it, $(-1.2, -1.6)$ through experimentation, knowing the values had to be negative and seemingly between $-2$ and $-1$. The solution is to substitute a known element from one of the formulas into the other. In this case, we can say $y = 3x + 2$, and then plug that in to $x^2 + (3x+2)^2 = 4$, which can then be expanded and solved for $(0,2)$ or $\left(-\frac{6}{5}, -\frac{8}{5}\right)$

29. Consider circle with center $C$ at $(-1, 2)$ and radius $5$. The point $P$ $(3,-1)$ lies on the circle. The line tangent to the circle at $P$ can be described as $ax + by = c$. Those values are not unique, but the ratios $\frac{a}{c}$ and $\frac{b}{c}$ are. Find the ratios.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Two points}&: (-1,2), (3,-1)\\
    \text{Direction}&: (4, -3) \\
    \text{Perpendicular}&: (3,4) \\
    \vec{CP}\text{ Formula}&: 3x + 4y = c \\
    \text{Plug in}&: 3*3 + 4*-1 = 5 \\
    &: 3*-1 + 4*2 = 5 \\
    \end{align}
    $$

    I tinkered manually until arriving at:

    ```{r}
    data.frame(x = seq(-1,3,1)) |> ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x, y = (5-3*x)/4)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5,5,1)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-5,5,1)) + geom_line(aes(x, y=(4*x-15)/3))
    ```

    Which gives $4x - 3y = 15$. I was on the right course - here's the given solution:

    $\vec{CP} = \begin{pmatrix}4\\-3\end{pmatrix}$ is orthogonal to the tangent line (yep, got that), hence we can take $a=4$ and $b=-3$. And we know $P$ should be on the line, so $c = \begin{pmatrix}4\\-3\end{pmatrix}  \cdot \begin{pmatrix}3\\-1\end{pmatrix} = (4*3) + (-3*-1) = 15$.

30. The line $3x + y = 6$ is tangent to a circle around the origin. What are the coordinates $(a,b)$ of intersection? Note, you don't need to know the radius; vector $\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$ must be orthogonal to the line? Why?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Two points}&: (0,6), (1,3) \\
    \text{Direction}&: (1,-3) \\\\
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\-3\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix} &= 0  \\
    1*a -3*b &= 0 \\
    1*a -3*(6-3b) &= 0 \\
    a -18 + 9a &= 0 \\
    10a &= 18 \\
    a &= \frac{9}{5} \\
    1*\frac{9}{5} -3b &= 0\\
    b &= \left(\frac{9}{5}\right) / 3 = \frac{3}{5} \\
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    data.frame(x = seq(-5,5,1)) |> ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x, y = (6-3*x))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-5,5,1)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20,20,1)) + annotate('point', x=0,y=0) + annotate('line', x=c(0,3), y=c(0,1)) + annotate('point', x=9/5, y=3/5)

31. Consider upper half of circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $3$. Which is a valid parameterization?

    i.  $$
        \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=& 3\cos(t)\\y(t)&=& 3\sin(t)\end{array}\right.,\text{with } 0\leq t\leq 2\pi.
        $$\
        No, this is the whole circle

    ii. $$
        \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=& -3\cos(t)\\y(t)&=& 3\sin(t)\end{array}\right.,\text{with } 0\leq t\leq \pi.
        $$\
        Yes, but wrong?!

    iii. $$
         \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=& 3\sin(t)\\y(t)&=& 3\cos(t)\end{array}\right.,\text{with } 0\leq t\leq \pi.
         $$\
         No, this is the right half

    iv. $$
        \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=& t\\y(t)&=& \sqrt{9-t^2}\end{array}\right.,\text{with } -3\leq t\leq 3.
        $$\
        Ah, $ii$ and $iv$.

32. Consider line parameterized by $\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} x(t) &=& 7-2t\\y(t) &=&-1+4t\end{array}\right.$\
    Suppose we want to limit the parameterization to the line segment between $(10,-7)$ and $(-3, 19)$, by restricting $t$ to the interval $[a,b]$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    7 - 2t &= 10 \Rightarrow t = -\frac{3}{2} \\
    7 - 2t &= -3 \Rightarrow t = 5
    \end{align}
    $$

33. Consider the line defined by $4x + 3y = 5$. Suppose it is parameterized by $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, and that $x(t) = t^3$. What is $y(t)$?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    t=-3 \Rightarrow x(t)=-27 \Rightarrow 4*-27 + 3*y = 5 \Rightarrow y=\frac{113}{3}\\
    t=-2 \Rightarrow x(t)=-8 \Rightarrow 4*-8 + 3*y = 5 \Rightarrow y=\frac{37}{3} \\
    t=-1 \Rightarrow x(t)=-1 \Rightarrow 4*-1 + 3*y = 5 \Rightarrow y=\frac{9}{3} \\
    t=0 \Rightarrow x(t)=0   \Rightarrow 4*0 + 3*y=5    \Rightarrow y=\frac{5}{3} \\
    t=1 \Rightarrow x(t)=1   \Rightarrow 4*1 + 3*y=5    \Rightarrow y=\frac{1}{3} \\
    t=2 \Rightarrow x(t)=8   \Rightarrow 4*8 + 3*y=5    \Rightarrow y=-\frac{27}{3} \\
    t=3 \Rightarrow x(t)=27  \Rightarrow 4*27 + 3*y=5   \Rightarrow y=-\frac{103}{3} \\
    (4*(-t)^3 + 5)/3 \\\\
    \text{Easier... the given solution:}\\
    4x + 3y = 5 \Rightarrow y = \frac{5-4x}{3} \Rightarrow y = \frac{5-4t^3}{3}
    \end{align}
    $$

34. Match the parameterizations. Four are given, with eight images - two lines, two arcs, two ovals, and two s-shaped curves.

    This one is clearly a line; and clearly $y$ is always positive so there is only one possibility.

    $$
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&-2 + 3\cos(t)\\ y(t)&=&4 - 2t\end{array}\right.\
    \text{with } 0 \le t \le 1
    $$

    This one would seem to be circular. Given the multipliers, it should be wider than tall.

    $$
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&3\cos(t)\\     y(t)&=&2\sin(t)\end{array}\right.\
    \text{with } 0 \le t \le 2\pi
    $$

    I plotted this one... In hindsight, the behavior of $y$ suggests a wave, so one of the two s-curves.

    $$
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&2\sin(t)\\ y(t)&=&t\end{array}\right.\
    \text{with } -\pi \le t \le \pi
    $$

    Evidently a semi-circle, given the range; and $cos(-pi) = -1$, $cos(0) = 1$, leaving one choice.

    $$
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} x(t)&=&\sin(t)\\ y(t)&=&\cos(t)\end{array}\right.\
    \text{with } -\pi \le t \le 0
    $$

35. Suppose path of object is given as:

    $$
    \left\{ \begin{array}{} x(t)&=&t^3 - 9t\\ y(t)&=&5 - t^2\end{array}\right.\
    \text{with } -\infty \le t \le \infty
    $$

    1.  Find velocity $\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_x\\ v_y \end{pmatrix}$ and the speed at $t = 2$

    2.  Find point $P$ at which the object moves vertically up

    3.  Find the minimal value that the norm of acceleration attains

    4.  The path intersects itself at $(0, -4)$. What is the angle of incidence?

36. Suppose an object moves along a circle, and at time $t$, its position is given by $P = (3 + cos(5t), 7 + sin(5t))$. Let $C$ be the center of the circle, and $\vec{v}$ the velocity vector at time $t$. Find the vectors $\vec{CP}$ and $\vec{v}$, and the angle between them.
