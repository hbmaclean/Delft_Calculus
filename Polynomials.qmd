# Polynomials

The simplest polynomials are those with degree 0, which can be written as $f(x) = ax^0$. Since $x^0$ is 1, these are constant, linear functions, which when graphed are horizontal lines.

Polynomials with degree 1 have the form, $f(x) = ax + b$. These are also linear, with $a$ measuring the slope and $b$ the y-intercept.

Polynomials with degree 2 have the form, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. These are called quadratic, and form a parabola when graphed.

## Quadratic Representations

Quadratic formulas are commonly represented in three forms - standard, factorized, and complete-square.

### More on Complete Square Form

Given the standard form, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, and for simplicity we consider the case where $a = 1$, we can visualize an $x$-by-$x$ square, an $x$-by-$b$ rectangle, and a scrap $c$.

![](images/clipboard-3921172509.png)

We can then split the rectangle along $b$ and glue the halves to the square:

![](images/clipboard-3498327512.png)

And then complete the square with a $(1/2b)(1/2b)$ piece of $c$:

![](images/clipboard-2653620642.png)

Since area is unchanged, we obtain:

$$
x2 + bx + c = (x + \frac{1}{2}b)^2 + c - \frac{1}{4}b^2
$$

Note that the right-hand side is the complete square form $a(x-r)^2 + s$, with $a = 1$, $r = -\frac{1}{2}b$ (note the minus sign), and $s = c - \frac{1}{4}b^2$.

**Exercises**

Given a quadratic formula in standard form, show the equivalent complete-square form and its $a$, $r$, and $s$ values.

| Given Standard Form | Complete Square Form | $a$ | $r$ | $s$ |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| $x^2 + 6x + 13$     | $(x+3)^2+4$          | 1   | -3  | 4   |
| $x^2 + 10x + 7$     | $(x + 5)^2 - 18$     | 1   | -5  | -18 |
| $3x^2 - 12x + 9$    | $3(x - 2)^2 -3$      | 3   | 2   | -3  |

### More on the Factorized Form

In general, converting standard form, $ax^2 + bx + c$ to factored form, $a(x - p)(x - q)$, amounts to solving two equations: $p + q = - \frac{b}{a}$ and $p * q = \frac{c}{a}$.

In some cases, this can be done easily enough by inspection. But again, not every quadratic polynomial can be factored. Consider $x^2 - 2x + 2$. When graphed, the parabola does not intersect the x-axis - there are no zeros:

![](images/clipboard-27038792.png)

**Exercises**

| Given Polynomial | Can Be Factored as $a(x-p)(x-q)$       | $a$ | $p$ | $q$ |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| $5x^2 - 20$      | $5(x - 2)(x + 2)$                      | 5   | -2  | 2   |
| $x^2 - 4x + 7$   | no                                     |     |     |     |
| $3x^2 + 9x - 30$ | $3(x^2 + 3x - 10)$ = $3(x - 2)(x + 5)$ | 3   | -2  | 5   |

After using UI to adjust line between points A (1, 3) and B (9/2, 3/2), give the exact equation for the line.

Note, for this, I had to research on the side, from [MATHisFUN](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html).

Calculate Slope:

$a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)$

$a = (3/2 - 3) / (9/2 - 1)$

$a = -\frac{3}{2} / \frac{7}{2}$

$a = -\frac{3}{2}* \frac{2}{7}$

$a = -\frac{6}{14}$

Point-slope Formula:

$y - y_1 = a(x - x_1)$

$y - 3 = -\frac{6}{14}(x - 1)$

$y - 3 = -\frac{3x}{7} + \frac{3}{7}$

$y = -\frac{3x}{7} + \frac{24}{7}$

Exercise 8

Given vertex and x-intercepts, determine $ax^2 + bx +c$

vertex at 1,2 - thus: $a(x-1)^2 + 2$

x-intercepts at -1 and 3 - thus: $a(x+1)(x-3)$

Therefore: $a(x-1)^2 + 2$ = $a(x+1)(x-3)$

Expanded: $a(x^2 -2x +1) + 2$ = $a(x^2 -2x -3)$

Further: $ax^2 - 2ax + 1a +2 = ax^2 - 2ax -3a$

Solve for $a$:

$1a+2 = -3a$

$2 = -4a$

$\frac{2}{-4} = a = -\frac{1}{2}$

Standard Form: $\frac{-1}{2}x^2 + 1x + \frac{3}{2}$

# Rational Functions

A rational function is the quotient, or *ratio*, of two polynomials.

An example is for a commute comprised of 3km that takes a constant 6 minutes (1/10hr) and 20km that depends on highway traffic. Average speed is therefore $23/(\frac{1}{10} + 20v)$. Multiplying numerator and denominator by $v$ gives $23v/(\frac{1}{10}v + 20)$, which is a quotient of two linear polynomials.

In general, rational functions can be written as $P/Q$, where both are polynomials constructed of a variable, numbers, addition and multiplication (and therefore subtraction and division.)

$Q$ cannot be a constant zero.

Otherwise, constant functions are also polynomials - and so taking the denominator $Q=1$, we see that any polynomial is also a rational function.

Rational functions provide cases we could not define earlier, even simple cases where the numerator is constant or the denominator is a power of $x$.

Rational functions cannot be defined at a point $x$ where the denominator is zero. We say that the zeros of the denominator are not in the "domain" of the function.

Rational functions can be calculated like ordinary fractions. To sum two rational functions, put both terms over a common denominator. For example, to add $\frac{1}{(x-2)}$ and $\frac{1}{(x^2+2)}$, use the product of the two denominators as a common unit: $\frac{(x-2)+(x^2+2)}{(x-2)(x^2+2)}$, or simplified, $\frac{(x^2+x)}{(x-2)(x^2+2)}$

Tip: Typically factored expressions are easiest to work with, so refrain from expanding the denominator if possible.

## Graphing Rational Functions

It is generally difficult to draw the graph of a rational function.

One characteristic of such a graph are lines that approach the curve but do not meet it at any finite distance; i.e., the distance between the line and the curve approaches zero as one or both of the x/y coordinates tends to infinity. These are asymptotes.

### Horizontal Asymptotes

For example, $\frac{(2x^2 + 2x - 1)}{(x^2 + x + 1)}$ has a horizontal asymptote for $x$ to infinity; meaning that for very large $x$, positive or negative, the graph approaches a horizontal line very closely. In this case, the line is at $y = 2$.

A rational function has a horizontal asymptote if the degree of the numerator is at most the degree of the denominator.

The location of the horizontal asymptote can be determined by dividing both numerator and denominator by the largest power of $x$ in the denominator. For the example above, divide top and bottom by $x^2$ to get $\frac{2 + 2\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x^2}}{1+\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x^2}}$

For very large $x$, the terms $\frac{1}{x}$, $\frac{1}{x^2}$, $2\frac{1}{x}$, etc. tend to zero, leading to constant $\frac{2}{1}$, i.e. $y = 2$.

### Vertical Asymptotes

Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)}$. For $x = 2$, the denominator is zero and the function is not defined. For $x$ slightly greater or less than 2, $\frac{1}{x}$ is very large. Therefore the graph has a vertical asymptote at $x=2$.

A rational function can only have vertical asymptotes at zeros of the denominator.

But - there is no vertical asymptote if the numerator also vanishes when the denominator is zero. For example, for $\frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x-2)}$, top and bottom are zero for $x = 1$. When graphing, we denote that 1 is not in the function domain by adding an open circle at $x = 1$.

### Oblique Asymptotes

Consider $f(x) = x + 2 + \frac{1}{x+1}$. For very large values, positive and negative, $\frac{1}{x+1}$ becomes very small. Thus, $x + 2$ becomes near constant, and there is a line at $y = x + 2$.

### Zeros of Rational Functions

A rational function can only intersect the x-axis if the numerator is zero, and the denominator is NOT zero:

$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = 0$ whenever $P(x) = 0$ and $Q(x) \neq 0$

## Exercises: Rational Functions

1.  Where is the horizontal asymptote of $f(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x + 1}{2x^2 + 6x -2}$

    Divide both by largest degree of $x$ in denominator, \$x\^2\$: $\frac{ \frac{x^2}{x^2} + \frac{3x}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^2} }{ \frac{2x^2}{x^2} + \frac{6x}{x^2} - \frac{2}{x^2}  }$

    That approaches $\frac{1}{2}$ with large enough $x$, all other terms approaching zero

2.  What is the zero of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2} - \frac{x}{x ^2 + 3}$

    $\frac{1}{x-2}(\frac{x^2+3}{x^2+3}) - \frac{x}{x^2+3}(\frac{x-2}{x-2})$

    $\frac{x^2+3}{(x-2)(x^2+3)} - \frac{x^2 -2x}{(x-2)(x^2+3)}$

    $\frac{(x^2+3)-(x^2-2x)}{(x-2)(x^2+3)}$

    $\frac{2x+3}{(x-2)(x^2+3)}$

    $2x + 3 = 0$

    $2x = -3$

    $x = \frac{-3}{2}$

3.  Match formulas:

    +---------------------------------+--------------------------+------------+-------+

# Power Functions

A power function is a function of the form $f(x) - x^a$, where the exponent $a$ is a constant.

Examples include:

-   area of a circle, given radius $r$: $f(x) = \pi r^2$
-   edge of a cube, given volume $v$: $f(x) = v^\frac{1}{3}$
-   gravitational force on a satellite with distance $r$ from the center of the earth: $f(x) = r^{-2}$

Properties of such a function depend strongly on whether the exponent is positive or negative, and integer or not.

## Positive Integer Exponents

When the exponent is an integer larger than zero, the power function is a special case of polynomial of degree $a$. It is also called a monomial and can be seen as a repeated product.

When the exponent is zero, the power function is just the constant 1.

With positive integer exponents, there are some calculation rules:

-   $x^a * x^b$ is a product of $a$ plus $b$ x's, and is therefore $x^{a+b}$
-   $(x^a) ^b$ is a product of $b$ factors of $x^a$, and is therefore $x^{a*b}$
-   $(xy)^a$ is a product of $a$ factors of $x*y$

## Negative Integer Exponents

From the calculation rules above, we know that $x^{-3} * x ^3 = x ^{-3+3} = x ^0 = 1$, which implies that $x^{-3} = \frac{1}{x^3}$. Therefore, we can deduce another calculation rule:

-   $\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$

## Graphing Power Functions

$f(x) = x^0$ is a constant one, and thus a horizontal line.

$f(x) = x^1$ is just $x$, and so a diagonal line.

$f(x) = x^2$ is a parabola.

$f(x) = x^3$ is a double curve

Subsequent, even exponents closely resemble the parabola of $x^2$. These are called even functions; and for them, $f(-x)$ = $f(x)$ for all $x$. Graphs for even functions are symmetric in the vertical axis.

Subsequent, odd exponents closely resemble the curve of $x^3$. These are called odd functions; and for them, $f(-x)$ = $-f(x)$ for all $x$. Graphs for odd functions are "point symmetric" in the origin - one half-rotation is identical.

$f(x) = x^{-1}$ is a hyperbola, with two arcs in the upper right and lower left quadrants, bending toward $(0,0)$.

$f(x) = x^{-2}$ has two arcs in the upper quadrants, bending toward $(0,0)$.

Again, subsequent exponents resemble the two cases above; all having a horizontal asymptote at $y = 0$ and vertical at $x = 0$. And again, negative even functions are symmetric on the vertical axis and the negative odd functions are point-symmetric in the origin.

## Exercises - Is Exponent Even/Odd, Pos/Neg?

For the following graphs, indicate whether exponent is even or odd, and positive or negative.

![](images/clipboard-1222026863.png)

-   A: even, negative
-   B: even, positive
-   C: odd, positive
-   D: odd, negative

## Non-Integer Exponents

For negative non-integer exponents, power functions are only possible in exceptional cases, to be discussed later.

For positive non-integer exponents, we can use the known calculation rules. For example, for $x ^{\frac{1}{4}}$, we know that $(x^{\frac{1}{4}}) ^4 = x^1 = x$. Therefore, $x^{\frac{1}{4}} = \root 4\of x$, and generally for positive integer $n$, $x^{\frac{1}{n}} = \root n \of x$.

For even values of $n$, resulting graphs resemble the following. They are only defined for non-negative values of $x$ (intuitively, since negatives have no even root.) We say the domain is $[0, \infty]$.

![](images/clipboard-585532644.png){width="350"}

For odd values of $n$, resulting graphs resemble the following, for domain $[\infty, \infty]$. These are again point-symmetric in the origin; and we again note that $f(-x) = -f(x)$.

![](images/clipboard-1921778727.png){width="349"}

For fractional exponents with a numerator other than 1:

-   positive example: $x^{\frac{2}{3}} = (x ^2) ^\frac{1}{3} = \root 3 \of {x^2}$; and also, $x^\frac{2}{3} = (x ^\frac{1}{3}) ^2 = (\root 3 \of x)^2$
-   negative example: $x^\frac{-5}{2} = (\frac{1}{x ^5})^\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^5}}$; and also $x^{-\frac{5}{2}} = (\sqrt{x})^{-5} = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{x})^5}$

And so generally,

-   for positive integers $p$ and $q$, $x^\frac{p}{q} = \root q \of {x^p} = (\root q \of x) ^p$
-   and for negative integers, $x^{-\frac{p}{q}} = \frac{1}{\root q \of {x^p}} = \frac{1}{(\root q \of x)^p}$

## General Properties

For which values of $x$ is $x^a$ defined?

+---------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
|                                       | $a \ge 0$ | $a < 0$   |
+=======================================+===========+===========+
| In general                            | $x \ge 0$ | $x > 0$   |
+---------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Integer $a$                           | all $x$   | $x \ne 0$ |
|                                       |           |           |
| ... or $a = \frac{p}{q}$ with odd $q$ |           |           |
+---------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+

When exponent $a$ is positive, $x^a$ increases with $x$:

![](images/clipboard-1442867714.png){width="297"}

When $a$ is negative, $x^a$ decreases with $x$; and there are asymptotes at $x=0$ and $y=0$:

![](images/clipboard-642347523.png){width="300" height="322"}

And if defined for $x < 0$, there is either line symmetry along y-axis:

![](images/clipboard-3172173621.png){width="323"}

Or point-symmetry at origin:

![](images/clipboard-1559235920.png){width="329"}

Now, consider a graph of $f(x) = x^2$ and $f(x) = x^3$:

![](images/clipboard-1637137005.png)

Note that if $x > 1$ and $a < b$, then $x^a < x ^b$. By example, if $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = x^3$, then $g(x) = x * f(x)$; and since $x > 1$ and both functions are positive, $g(x)$ is clearly larger. In the graph above, $y$ increases faster with $f(x) = x^3$ for $x > 1$.

This inequality reverses for $0 < x < 1$. By the same logic, $g(x) = x * f(x)$, and since $x$ is fractional, the result is smaller. This is visible in the graph above, with the lines crossing at $(1,1)$.

## Exercise - Match Graphs and Formulas

Match the following formulas to the graphs below.

![](images/clipboard-3647059616.png)

Note cases of symmetry, on y-axis for even exponents and origin for odd exponents.

## Exercises - Rewriting Power Function Expressions

$\root 3 \of x = x^a$ for $a$: 1/3

$\frac{1}{\root 5 \of x} = x^a$ for $a$: -1/5

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3}} = x^a$ for $a$: -3/2

Given $\frac{x^{\frac{3}{2}}} {x^{\frac{1}{2}} * \root 3 \of {x^{10}*x^2}   } = x^a$, for which $a$ does the formula hold, assuming $x > 0$?

Cube-root portion: $\root 3 \of {x^{10}*x ^2}$ = $(x^{10} * x ^2) ^{\frac{1}{3}}$ = $(x^{12}) ^{\frac{1}{3}}$ = $x^4$

Thus denominator: $x^{\frac{1}{2}} * x ^4$ = $x^{\frac{9}{2}}$

Therefore: $\frac{ x^{\frac{3}{2}}  }{ x ^{\frac{9}{2}} } = \frac{1}{x ^3} = x^a$

Multiply both by $x^3$: $1 = x^3 * x ^a = x ^{3+a}$

And, $a = -3$

Given $\sqrt{\frac{(x^2*y)^{-3}}{y^{-1}*x}} = x^a * y ^b$, for which $a$ and $b$ does the formula hold, assuming $x > 0$ and $y > 0$?

Square both sides: $\frac{(x^2*y) ^{-3}}{x*y^{-1}} = (x^a * y ^b) ^2$

Simplify left side: $\frac{ \frac{1}{(x^2*y)^{3}} } {x*\frac{1}{y}}$ = $\frac{1}{(x^2*y)^3} * \frac{y}{x}$ = $\frac{y}{x* x^6 * y ^3}$ = $\frac{y}{x^7*y^3}$

$\frac{y}{x^7*y^3} = (x^a * y^b)^2$

$y = (x^a * y ^b) ^2 * x ^7 y ^3$

$y = x^{2a+7}y ^{2b+3}$

$1 = \frac{x^{2a+7}y ^{2b+3}}{y}$ = $x^{2a+7} y ^{2b+2}$

Therefore, $a = -7/2$ and $b = -1$ (because they make the exponents zero, the only way to get a product of 1)

Note: The given solution was different:

1.  Rewrite fraction within $\sqrt{}$: $\frac{(x^2*y) ^{-3}}{y ^{-1}*x} = \frac{(x ^2)^{-3}*y ^{-3}}{y ^{-1}*x} = x ^{-6} * y ^{-3} * y ^1 * x ^{-1} = x ^{-7} * y ^{-2}$
2.  Then it follows that: $\sqrt{  \frac{(x ^2*y)^{-3}}{y ^{-1}*x} } = \sqrt{x ^{-7}y ^{-2}} = (x ^{-7} * y ^ {-2}) ^{\frac{1}{2}} = x ^{-\frac{7}{2}} * y ^{-1}$

# Catch the Error!

$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{x^2} &= \sqrt{x*x} \\
&= (x*x)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= x^{\frac{1}{2}} * x^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
&= x^{(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2})} \\
&= x
\end{align}
$$

But... that says $\sqrt{-1^2} = 1$.

The problem is, rules of calculation for power functions are not always true for negative and/or fractional exponents.

# Domain, Codomain, and Range

The **domain** of a function is the set of possible inputs. The function $f(x) = 2 + \sqrt{(x-3)}$ is defined for all $x > 3$. Thus, the maximal domain is $[3, \infty]$.

But, while the function $f(x) = x^3$ is defined for all $x$, in the context of calculating volume of a cube, negative $x$ makes no sense - and so we would define the domain of the function as numbers greater than or equal to zero.

**Codomain** *contains* the set of possible outputs (and may be a superset). Since every function we consider produces real numbers, we can just take the set of real numbers (${\rm I\!R}$) as the domain.

**Range** is the set of possible outputs - the set of all $y$ values for which $f(x) = y$ has a solution.

In general, determining the maximal domain and range involves solving equations and inequalities, which can be difficult.

## Exercise - Natural Domain

Given a 40m rope to delimit a rectangle, if one side has length $x$, the total area is $f(x) = x * (20 - x)$.

The function is defined for all $x$ in ${\rm I\!R}$, but given the context what is the natural domain for the function?

Natural domain $[a,b]$ is, $a = 0$ and $b = 20$.

Range $[c,d]$ is, $c = 0$ and $d = 100$.

Explanation: The edges of the rectangle cannot be negative. So we must have $x \ge 0$ and $x \le 20$ (we include here the possibility of edges of zero length, since, in principle, this is possible to achieve). For all values of $x$ that meet these requirements, we can create a corresponding rectangle. So the natural domain for the function is the interval $[0,20]$.

What is the range? Note that the function is a quadratic polynomial. The graph is a parabola which intersects the x-axis at $x = 0$ and $x = 20$ (the boundaries of the natural domain). The x-coordinate of the vertex lies exactly in between at $x = 10$. The y-coordinate equals $f(10) = 100$. Since the vertex is the highest point, it follows that the range is $[0,100]$.

# Continuity

Imagine a film of a bouncing basketball. The higher the frame rate, the more fluid the motion - because distance traveled is a *continuous* function of time.

For a continuous function, if we take any two close points $x_1$ and $x_2$, then the results $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ will be close: A small change on the x-axis results in a small change on the y-axis.

A function that is continuous at any point in its domain is called a continuous function.

Now imagine a bank account balance: This would be associated with a discontinuous function - different formulas at different intervals. This is known as piecewise-defined.

Another piecewise-defined example is the absolute value function, which gives $-x$ for negative values and $x$ for non-negative values. This is also continuous, as the results for any two near points will be near.

Continuous functions have an "intermediate value" property, which says that if $f(x)$ is continuous on a *closed* interval $[a,b]$, then it attains all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Thus, one could draw the associated graph without removing pen from paper.

The intermediate value property guarantees, for example, that $x^5 - x ^2 + 1 = 0$ has at least one solution on the interval $[-1,0]$ - even though we cannot calculate it exactly. This is because the function is continuous and attains positive and negative values on $[-1,0]$, so it must be zero at some point.

We can visualize all of this with a graph of the function - that there is a $p$ in $[-1,0]$ such that $f(p) = 0$.

![](images/clipboard-3305732893.png)

Most functions we've seen so far are continuous. Polynomials, rational functions, and power functions are continuous on every point of their domains. Even though $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ has a domain of ${\rm I\!R}$ except 0, it is continuous on its domain.

If we construct a new function by adding/multiplying two continuous functions, the result is continuous. For example, $f(x) = \sqrt{x}/(x-1)$ is continuous on its domain, which is numbers larger than 0 except 1.

This does not necessarily hold for piecewise-defined functions. For example, a function which is $x$ for $x < 0$ and 1 for $x \ge 0$ comprises two continuous functions, but is itself discontinuous because there is a jump at $x = 0$.

## Exercises - Continuous or Discontinuous?

Is $f(x)$ continuous or discontinuous?

$$
f(x) =     \begin{cases}    2-x^2  & \text{if}\ x \leq  1 \\ \\    \sqrt{2x+2} & \text{if} \ x>1    \end{cases}
$$

I got this wrong (continuous) b/c I plotted it as follows (without 'color', and for just -5:5) and, duh, the line was continuous:

```{r warning = FALSE}
data.frame(
    x = seq(-5,5,.01)
) |>
    ggplot(aes(x, ifelse(x > 1, sqrt(x*2 + 2), 2-x^2), color = factor(x>1))) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point()
```

Thinking it through afterward, if $x = 1$, $f(x) = 2 - 1^2 = 1$, while if $x = 1.000000001$, $f(x) \approx 2$.

Is $g(x)$ continuous?

$$
g(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    2-x^2  & \text{if}\ x \leq  1 \\ \\
    \sqrt{2x-1} & \text{if} \ x>1
    \end{cases}
$$

```{r warning = FALSE}
data.frame( x = seq(-5,5,.01) ) |>
    ggplot(aes(x, ifelse(x > 1, sqrt(x*2 - 1), 2-x^2), color = factor(x>1))) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point()
```

On its maximal domain, is $h(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ continuous?

I said discontinuous, thinking "maximal" included zero...

## Exercise 6 - Find the Function

1.  $f(x)$ is the linear function whose graph has slope $\frac{1}{2}$ and passes through point $(4,1)$. Find $a$ and $b$ such that $f(x) = ax + b$.

    Slope: $a = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)$

    So, $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{y_2 - 1}{x_2 - 4}$

    I just figured, if it hits $x=4, y=1$ and rise-over-run is $\frac{1}{2}$, then it'll hit $(6,2), (8,3), (10,4), ...$, a pattern of $\frac{1}{2}x - 1$.

    The given explanation is, if $f(x) = ax + b$, then $a$ is the slope of the graph and $b$ is the y-intercept - i.e., $f(0)$. Given the formula, the one point, and the slope, we know that $f(4) = \frac{1}{2}4 + b = 1$, so $b = -1$.

2.  $f(x)$ is a linear function such that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(6) = -2$. Find $a$ and $b$ such that $f(x) = ax + b$.

    This gives two points, $(2,1)$ and $(6, -2)$.

    Therefore slope is $(-2 - 1)/(6 -2) = -\frac{3}{4}$, and therefore we know that $f(6) = -\frac{3}{4}6 + b = -2$, thus $b = \frac{5}{2}$.

    If so, $f(2) = -\frac{3}{4}2 + \frac{5}{2} = 1$, yep!

3.  A cart is attached to a wall by a spring. $x$ is the position of the cart in centimeters. The spring force is a linear function of $x$, positive if it points right, negative to the left. Length of spring at equilibrium is 20cm. If we *push* the cart 5cm from its equilibrium (i.e., length is compressed to 15), the exerted force is 10N. Find $a$ and $b$ such that $f(x) = ax + b$, measured in N(ewton).

    This is linear, so $a$ is slope and $b$ is y-intercept. Given two points, $(15,10)$ and $(20,0)$, slope is $(10-0)/(15-20) = -2$, so:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    f(15) &= -2(15) + 40 = 10 \\
    f(20) &= -2(20) + 40 = 0 \\
    f(25) &= -2(25) + 40 = -10 \\
    \end{align}
    $$

4.  $f(x)$ is a quadratic function whose graph intersects the x-axis at -1 and 3; and intersects the y-axis at 12.

    a.  Find $a$, $p$, and $q$ such that $f(x) = a(x-p)(x-q)$ with $p < q$.

        In this form, $p$ and $q$ are the x-intercepts; so we have $f(x) = a(x + 1)(x - 3)$.

        Therefore we know $f(-1) = 0$ and $f(3) = 0$. We are also given the y-intercept $(0,12)$ and so $f(0) = a(x+1)(x-3) = a(1)(-3) = 12$.

        Logically, the vertex must be midway between the two x-intercepts; and higher than the y-intercept since the parabola is right of center, so $(1, 12+)$.

        Knowing the y-intercept, we have $f(0) = a(0^2 -20 -3) = 12$, thus $a = -4$, and $p$ and $q$ were given as x-intercepts.

    b.  Find $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$

        Knowing $a$, $p$, and $q$, we have:

        $$
        \begin{align}
        f(x) &= a(x+1)(x-3) \\
        &= a(x^2 -2x -3) \\
        &= ax^2 -2ax -3a \\
        &= -4x^2 + 8x + 12
        \end{align}
        $$

5.  Given a suspension bridge with pillars 20m apart; and cables attached to pillars 5m above the deck; and sagging lowest to 1m above deck - find height $h$ in meters of the main cable above the deck as a function of the distance $x$ from the left pillar, in the form $h(x) = a(x-r)^2 + s$.

    I think we can say the low point, $(0,1)$, is the y-intercept; and thus we'd also have points $(\pm10,5)$ where cables are attached.

    In complete-square form, $r$ and $s$ are the x/y of the vertex, so we start with $a(x - 0)^2 + 1$, or $ax^2 + 1$.

    And we have

    $$
    \begin{align}
    h(10) &= 5 \\
    &= a10^2 +1 \\
    &= 1/25 * 10^2 + 1
    \end{align}
    $$

    Ah, I was wrong to assume that the vertex was $(0,1)$ - evidently the left pillar is the y-axis. Reading again, I note, "function of the distance $x$ *from the left pillar*".

## Exercise 7 - Asymptotes

Remember:

-   Verticals occur at denominator zeros - unless numerator is also zero.
-   Horizontals occur if degree of numerator is no larger than that of denominator; and can be found by dividing top and bottom by largest-degree $x$ in denominator
-   Obliques occur if a portion of the function becomes constant with very large/small $x$

## Exercise 8 - Domain and Range

| Formula | Maximal Domain | Range | Thoughts |
|----|----|----|----|
| $f(x) = (x-3)^4 + 5$ | $\rm I\!R$ | $y \ge 5$ | Fourth power will always give positive (or zero), so sum must be at least 5 |
| $f(x) = 3 + \frac{1}{x-5}$ | $x \ne 5$ | $\rm I\!R$ | The fraction can become anything with huge, tiny, positive, negative $x$ values |
| $f(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{x^2}$ | $x \ne 0$ | $\rm I\!R$ | Again, the fraction can become anything |
| $f(x) = \frac{x+3}{x^2+1}$ | $\rm I\!R$ | Was not asked, but $y \le 3$ | Minimal denominator is 1, thus 3; in all other cases the denominator eclipses the numerator |
| $f(x) = \frac{x}{x-3}$ | $x \ne 3$ | $y \le 4$ | $x>4$ gives a positive fraction; $x < 3$ gives a negative |
| $$
f(x)= \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
0 & \text{ for } x\lt -1\\
2x & \text{ for } -1\leq x\leq 1 \\
0 & \text{ for } x\gt 1

## Exercise 10 - Applications of Rational Functions

### A. Average Costs

Suppose fixed costs for a factory are 1M euros/year and cost per toy manufacturing is 3 euros. What is the average total cost per toy if the number of toys produced per year is $T$?

$(3 * T + 1000000)/T$

### B. Boat Trip

Boat travels 30km downstream then 30km back. The water flows at 8km/h. The boat travels at speed $v$ (km/hr) *with respect to the water*.

What is the downstream travel time, $T_{down}(v)$? $30/(v+8)$

What is the upstream travel time, $T_{up}(v)$? $30/(v-8)$

The total travel time, $T(v) = T_{down}(v) + T_{up}(v)$ can be written as $T(v) = \frac{P(v)}{Q(v)}$ where $P(v)$ and $Q(v)$ are polynomials. Find $T(v)$ (in hours) in this form. Make sure that $Q(v)$ has degree 2 and the coefficient of $v^2$ equals 1.

$$
\begin{align}
T(v) &= \frac{30}{v+8} + \frac{30}{v-8} \\
&= \left(\frac{30}{v+8}\right)\left(\frac{v-8}{v-8}\right) +
\left(\frac{30}{v-8}\right)\left(\frac{v+8}{v+8}\right) \\
&= \frac{30v - 240}{v^2 - 64} + \frac{30v + 240}{v^2 -64} \\
&= \frac{60v}{v^2 - 64}
\end{align}
$$

Given the context, what is the natural domain of $T(v)$? $v > 8$

## Exercise 11 - Application of Power Functions (Zipf's Law)

Zipf's Law is an empirical law that states that in many contexts, a function that relates rank to size can be approximated by a power function, $P(r) \approx C * r^a$, for some constants $C$ and $a$.

Below is a graph of the 150 largest cities in the Netherlands in 2014. Blue is actual, red is the $P(r) \approx C * r^a$ that best fits the points.

![](images/clipboard-682144877.png){width="670"}

Based on the above, what would best describe $a$?

-   $a \le -1$
-   $-1 < a < 0$ \<---- intuitively, it must be negative such that smaller rank is larger multiplier
-   $a = 0$
-   $0 < a < 1$
-   $a \ge 1$

Assuming the power function fits the following data perfectly, what is the estimated population of Rheden, rounded to the thousands?

| City       | Population | Rank |
|------------|------------|------|
| Leeuwarden | 107687     | 25   |
| Gouda      | 71018      | 50   |
| Rheden     | ?          | 100  |

I got this wrong. I tried to determine $C$ by trying $C * 25^{-.63}$, plugging that in for 50, and iterating around $a$ to find a value that worked well for both.

Easier, $a = 71018/107687$, and thus Rheden is $71018 * \frac{71018}{107687}$.

# Summary of Week 1

Function is a machine that takes a set of inputs (domain) and produces output that ends up in a set (codomain). Once domain is chosen, the set of values that can be produced is the range, which may be smaller than the codomain.

Functions can be described by formula, graph, table, and words.

## Polynomial Functions

Polynomial functions can be constructed from a variable, set of numbers, and addition and multiplication. Polynomials can be put in standard form, with no brackets; every power occurring once; and terms ordered in descending power. The highest power is the degree. The higher the degree, the more complicated the behavior and resulting graph. Polynomials with degree 0 are constant, and a horizontal line when graphed. Polynomials with degree 1 have the standard form $ax + b$, and are diagonal lines when graphed - with slope $a$ and y-intercept $b$. Polynomials with degree 2 are quadratic, of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, and are parabolas when graphed.

![](images/clipboard-844619978.png)

There are three representations for quadratic functions:

-   Standard: $ax^2 + bx + c$

-   Factorized: $a(x-p)(x-q)$

-   Complete Square: $a(x-r)^2 + s$

    Where $p$ and $q$ are the x-intercepts; and $(r,s)$ are the coordinates of the vertex

## Rational Functions

Rational functions are constructed from a variable and a set of numbers using addition, multiplication, and division, and can be written as the quotient (or ratio) of two polynomials.

Rational functions may have asymptotes - straight lines that are approached by the graph. Vertical asymptotes, where the function grows to $\pm\infty$, can occur at $x$ values where the denominator is zero - but not if the numerator is also zero. Horizontal asymptotes can occur if the function tends to a constant at $x$ values much larger or smaller than zero. Horizontals can be identified by dividing top and bottom by largest degree $x$ of the denominator, and observing which elements will approach zero with large/small $x$.

## Power Functions

Power functions are of the form $x^a$. Domain issues:

-   $x>0$ : defined for all $a$
-   $x=0$ : defined for $a>0$ (because $0^{-a} = \infty$, and apparently in Calculus, $0^0$ is indeterminate)
-   $x<0$ : defined for all integer $a$, and some fractional $a$ such as $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{1}{5}$, ... (because nothing *squared* can be negative, but *cubed* can, etc.)

For $a>0$, the graph increases for positive $x$, and more sharply for larger $a$. For $a <0$, the reverse - the smaller the $a$, the closer to zero large $x$ becomes.

For integer $a$, graphs are symmetric in the y-axis if $a$ is even and symmetric in the origin if $a$ is odd.

| Calculation Rules |
|----|
| $$                                                                      
                                      \begin{align}                       
                                      x^{a}x^{b} &= x ^{a+b} \\           
                                      \frac{x^a}{x ^b} &= x ^{a-b}\\      
                                      (x^a)^b &= x^{a*b}\\                
                                      (xy)^a &= x^a y^a                   
                                      \end{align}                         
                                      $$ |

These rules hold for all $a$ and $b$ if $x$ and $y$ are positive - otherwise be careful!

## Continuous

All these functions are continuous on their maximal domain, meaning: Function values cannot jump; small changes to $x$ will affect small changes to $f(x)$. The results of summing, multiplying, and dividing two continuous functions is also continuous.

If a continuous function is defined on an interval $(a,b)$, then it will attain all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. This is the intermediate value property, and implies that the graph has no gaps.

Graphs with gaps require piecewise functions - different formulas for different intervals. (Though, piecewise functions can be continuous.)

For these, I used something like:

```{r}
data.frame(x = seq(-3,3,.1)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x, 1-x^2)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-3,3)) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-3,3))
```

At the moment, I am mystified why `aes(x, x^(1/3))` does not work - the lower left quadrant is not plotted. And because of that, it was indistinguishable from $\sqrt{x}$. Is this an R bug? $-3^{(1/3)}$ works, but that is probably negating after power.

Along with `ggplot`, I noted:

-   symmetry - which, if around origin must have odd exponent; and if around y-axis must have even exponent
-   only one linear function of the form $ax + b$
-   asymptotes - horizontal and vertical are very clear for $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{1-x^2}$

| $f(x) = \sqrt{3-x}$ | Domain, $x \le 3$ |
| $g(x) = \frac{1}{(x-3)^2 + 1}$ | Domain, $\rm I\!R$ since square is inherently positive |
| $h(x) = (x+5)^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ | Domain, $x \ne -5$ since formula is essentially $\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+5}}$ |
| $f(x) = 2(x+1)^2 + 3$ | Range, $y \ge 3$ |
| $g(x) = x^5$ | Range, $\rm I\!R$ since odd exponent allows negatives |
| $h(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{x-4}$ | Range, $y \ne 1$ |

For what values of $p$ and $q$ is the following function continuous?

$f_{p,q}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} x+p& \text{ for } x\leq 0\\ x^2+q & \text{ for } 0\lt x\lt 5 \\ 6x+5 & \text{ for } x\geq 5 \end{array} \right.$

From an earlier exercise, I think I need to check the boundaries, $x = 0$ and $x = 5$.

Then, for $x=0$, these must hold: $0+p$ and $0^2+q$

For $x=5$, these must hold: $5^2 +q$ and $6*5 + 5$

The latter gives 35, thus $q=10$?

        aes(
            x,

                x>5  ~ 6*x + 5,
                x > 0 & x < 5 ~ x^2 + 10
            ),
            color = case_when(
                x<=0 ~ 'red',
                x>5 ~ 'blue',

# Taylor Polynomials

Imagine here we want to calculate $y$ at $x=0.6$, that is the square root of 1.6:

![](images/clipboard-3721458695.png){width="231"}

A simple approximation would be to say that 0.6 is close to 0, and thus the value of the function at $x=0.6$ is approximately equal to that at $x=0$, which is 1. In essence, we draw a horizontal line at height 1:

![](images/clipboard-2833574130.png){width="338"}

A closer approximation is a line tangent to the graph at $x=0$:

![](images/clipboard-1755532383.png){width="334"}

That gives an estimate of 1.3, better than 1.

But the tangent line ($y=1+\frac{x}{2}$) is a polynomial of degree 1. We can do better with a degree-2 polynomial. $1+\frac{x}{2}-\frac{x^2}{8}$ is an example of a Taylor polynomial, and it tracks the graph quite well:

| Degree | Polynomial | Approximation |
|----|----|----|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | $1 + \frac{1}{2}x$ | 1.3 |
| 2 | $1 + \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2$ | 1.255 |
| 3 | $1 + \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16}x^3$ | 1.2685 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 32 | $1 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 ... \frac{14544636039226909}{9223372036854775808}x^{32}$ | 1.2649110640 |

Polynomials are among the easiest formulas, and high-degree ones are simple for calculators. This is how they approximate imaginary numbers to the desired length.

Evidently, in this context, [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) is a tool that quantifies the sensitivity to change of a function's output with respect to its input. The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point.

![](images/clipboard-667580719.png){width="172"}

Second derivative is the rate of change of the first derivative, indicating the curvature or concavity of a function's graph. It is found by taking the derivative of the derivative, with notation like $f"(x)$ or $d^2y/dx ^2$. A positive second derivative indicates an upward-facing parabola; negative down.
