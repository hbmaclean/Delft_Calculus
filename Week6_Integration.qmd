# Integration

An example of a need for integration is the determination of energy consumption of a home. If it were static, we could say $nKw/hr$; but that is not the case, with inconsistent usage and even solar supply.

Integration is the process of taking the limit of sums for increasingly smaller intervals. The sums are "Riemann sums" named after Bernhard Riemann.

1.  Break up interval into subintervals of size $\Delta x$

2.  Choose sample points $x_1, x_2, ...$

3.  Calculate Riemann sum

    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^Nf(x_i) * \Delta x
    $$

4.  Repeat, for an increasing number of subintervals and decreasing length of $\Delta x$

    $$
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{}
            \begin{align}
                \Delta x &\rightarrow 0 \\
                N &\rightarrow \infty
            \end{align}
        \end{array}
    \right.
    $$

The limit of the sums, as the size of $\Delta$ goes to zero is called the integral of the function on the given interval. We denote that as follows - the integral of $P(t)$ for $t$ ranging from $a$ to $b$, with $dt$ the limit of $\Delta t$:

$$
\int_a^b P(t)dt
$$

Interactive exercise showed curve with sliders to control number of subintervals and position of sample points (left/right/center of intervals). The integral to one decimal place was 5.7 with 100 subintervals; and could be approximated within .05 with just 5 subintervals when sample points are centered; and required 73 subintervals when sample points were on the left or right edge.

## Exercises

1.  Consider Riemann sums $\sum_{i=1}^Nf(x_i)\Delta x$ corresponding to integral $\int_0^{10}(10-\frac{1}{10}x^2)dx$, with the interval divided into $N=5$ intervals, $\Delta x = 2$.
    i.  Calculate sum $S$ with all $x_i$ in the middle of their subintervals.

        ```{r}
        sum(sapply(seq(1,9,2), function(x) { h <- 10 - (1/10)*x^2; 2*h}))
        ```

    ii. Find the largest possible sum, $S_{max}$.

        ```{r}
        sum(sapply(seq(1,9,2), function(x) { h <- 10 - (1/10)*(x-1)^2; 2*h}))
        ```

    iii. Find the smallest possible sum, $S_{min}$.

         ```{r}
         sum(sapply(seq(1,9,2), function(x) { h <- 10 - (1/10)*(x+1)^2; 2*h}))
         ```

# What Does Integral Mean?

While we can often think of an integral as an area - the area below a graph, above the x-axis. But when the function is negative, the area *above* the negative curve is subtracted. The resulting Riemann sum gives the *signed* area. This does not help determine how much paint would be needed, but is appropriate for energy consumption - where green energy may result in negative consumption.

![](images/clipboard-2605936815.png){width="291"}

So, the proper definition of integral is the signed area of the region enclosed by the graph, the x-axis, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$.

## Exercises

Determine the following integrals geometrically:

1.  $\int_0^3 2xdx \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(3*2*3) = 9$
2.  $\int_1^4 3-x dx \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}((2*2) - (1*1) = 1.5$
3.  $\int_{-\pi}^\pi sin(x)dx \Rightarrow 0$
4.  $\int_{-2}^2\sqrt{4-x^2}dx \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(\pi*2^2)$

# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Riemann sum rarely produces the exact value of an integral. Moreover, it can become a tedious calculation.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus holds that, given a function $f$ defined on $[a,b]$; and a function $F$ such that $f(x)$ is the derivative of $F(x)$, the following holds:

$$
\int_a^bf(x)dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$

In this case, $F$ is called a primitive function, or antiderivative of $f$. By this theorem, integration comes down to finding a primitive function $F$ and evaluating it at the boundaries.

For example:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= x^2 \\
F(x) &= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \\ 
\int_1^2x^2dx &= F(2) - F(1) \\
&= \frac{1}{3}2^3 - \frac{1}{3}1^3 \\
&= \frac{8}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
\end{align}
$$

And, an infinite number of primitives can be found, simply by adding a constant - which disappears from the derivative.

## Exercises

1.  In the example above, the fundamental theorem gave $\frac{7}{3}$. What is the geometric estimate, if we replace the curve of the integral with a straight line $PQ$?

    ![](images/clipboard-422593603.png){width="192"}

    Well, 1x1 square and 1x3 triangle, so $1*1 + \frac{1}{2}(1*3) = 2.5$

2.  Associate the following functions with their antiderivatives:

    i.  $x^5 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{6}x^6$
    ii. $sin(x) \Rightarrow -cos(x)$
    iii. $2^x \Rightarrow \frac{1}{ln(2)}2^x$
    iv. $\frac{1}{x} \Rightarrow ln|x|$
    v.  $e^x \Rightarrow e^x$
    vi. $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \Rightarrow 2\sqrt{x}$
    vii. $cos(x) \Rightarrow sin(x)$

3.  Select anti-derivatives of $f(x) = 4x^3 + 4x$.

    i.  $F_1(x) = 4x^3 + 4x \Rightarrow F_1'(x) = 12x^2 + 4$
    ii. $F_2(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 - 10 \Rightarrow F_2'(x) = 4x^3 + 4x \Longleftarrow$
    iii. $F_3(x) = (x^2 + 1)^2 \Rightarrow F_3'(x) = 4x^3 + 4x  \Longleftarrow$
    iv. $F_4(x) = 12x^2 + 4 \Rightarrow F_4'(x) = 24x$\$
    v.  $F_5(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 \Rightarrow F_5'(x) = 4x^3 + 4x  \Longleftarrow$

4.  Find $\int_1^2(4x3 + 4x)dx$

    $(2^4 + 2*2^2) - (1^4 + 2*1^2) = 24-3 = 21$

5.  Given $f(x) = 2^x$, for what $A$ is $F(x) = A * 2^x$ primitive for $f$?

    $A = \frac{1}{ln(2)}$

6.  Solve $\int_0^32^xdx$

    $\frac{1}{ln(2)}2^3 - \frac{1}{ln(2)}2^0 = \frac{7}{ln(2)}$

# Proof of the Fundamental Theorem

The Fundamental Theorem roughly says that integration and differentiation are inverse operations.

Given a function and a signed area $S$ for an integral $[a,t]$, if we extend the integral by say $\Delta t$, the claim is that $S' = f$.

![](images/clipboard-4268992696.png){width="390"}

If we zoom in on $\Delta S$, we can see that nearly a rectangle of width $\Delta t$ and height $f(t)$. We can make the approximation better by taking a smaller $\Delta t$. Thus it follows that $\Delta s \approx f(t) * \Delta t$ and $\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t} \approx f(t)$. And these become exact if we let $\Delta t$ tend to 0: $\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = f(t)$.

![](images/clipboard-1146987744.png){width="226"}

The quotient $\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}$ is a difference quotient for the function $S$, and the limit of the difference quotient is exactly the derivative of $S$ at $t$. Thus the derivative of $S$ is precisely $f$.

Equivalently we can say that $S$ is a primitive function of $f$.

Also note, if upper and lower bounds of an integral coincide the integral is 0. Thus:

$$
\begin{align}
S(a) &= \int_a^a f(x)dx = 0 \\
S(b) &= \int_a^b f(x)dx = S(b) - S(a)
\end{align}
$$

And that is the Fundamental Theorem - identify a primitive function and evaluate it at the bounds.

# Rules of Calculation

To understand calculation rules, it is good to have an illustrative example. Speed is the derivative of distance over time. From the Fundamental Theorem, it follows that distance is the integral of speed as a function of time.

## Multiplying by Constant

Now, if we travel at twice the speed, the distance covered also doubles. Indeed, if we multiply our speed by a constant $C$, the distance is also multiplied by $C$. Thus we obtain the rule that the integral of a constant $C$ times $f$ equals $C$ times the integral of $f$.

$$
\int Cf(x)dx = C\int f(x)dx
$$

Visually we see that the height of the area under the graph is multiplied by $C$, so the total area is also multiplied by $C$. Note that if the constant is negative, the area remains the same but is considered negative.

## Adding Two Functions

Imagine walking on a moving train. Your distance traveled equals the distance traveled by the train plus the distance you've covered in the train. If $f$ represents the speed of the train and $g$ represents your walking speed, the integral of the sum of the functions equals the sum of the integrals:

$$
\int f(x) + g(x)dx = \int f(x)dx + \int g(x)dx
$$

Visually, the original area under $g$ is deformed atop the area under $f$:

![](images/clipboard-454085678.png){width="120"}

## Integral of Zero Length

For any function, its integral $a$ to $a$ is zero - there is no area within a zero-width space.

## Splitting an Integral

For any integral $a$ to $c$, you can take an interim point $b$, and sum the integrals of $a$ to $b$ and $b$ to $c$.

## Integral with Backwards Interval

An integral $b$ to $a$, where $b>a$, is equal to that interval negated and reversed.

$$
\begin{align}
0 &= \int_a^a f(x)dx \\
&= \int_a^b f(x)dx + \int_b^a f(x)dx \\
\text{Therefore:}\\
\int_b^a f(x)dx &= -\int_a^b f(x)dx
\end{align}
$$

## Integral of Shifted Linear Function

Linear functions involve scaling (sending $x$ to a multiple of itself) and shifting (adding a constant.)

For a shifted function, e.g. $f(x+C)$, the graph of $f(x+C)$ equals the graph of $f(x)$, but shifted left by $C$.

The integrals are equal as well, but for the endpoints:

$$
\int_a^b f(x+C)dx = \int_{a+C}^{b+C}f(x)dx
$$

## Integral of Scaled Linear Function

For a scaled linear function, e.g. $f(2x)$, the graph of $f(2x)$ is equivalent to the graph of $f(x)$, but compressed by half towards the left. The area under the curve is also halved, as are the endpoints:

$$
\int_a^b f(2x)dx = \int_{2a}^{2b} \frac{1}{2}f(x)dx
$$

This holds for any constant:

$$
\int_a^b f(Cx)dx = \int_{aC}^{bC}\frac{1}{C}f(x)dx
$$

If the constant is negative, consider that $f(-x)$ is a reflection of $f(x)$. Equivalences hold if the endpoints are negated:

$$
\int_a^b f(-x)dx = \int_{-b}^{-a}f(x)dx = -\int_{-a}^{-b}f(x)dx
$$

## Substitution Method

For differentiation, there are numerous rules for dealing with combinations of functions. Unfortunately there is no such set of rules for integration, but there are several techniques for simplifying - one of which is substitution.

The key to evaluating an integral is to find an anti-derivative of the function. Once we have the anti-derivative $F$ and $F'(x) = f(x)$, we know:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a) \\
\text{Which can also be written as:}\\
\int f(x)dx = F(x) + C
$$

Consider $\int cos(x^3 + 5x)*(3x^2 + 5)$:

1.  The first factor can be written as $f(g(x))$, with $f(x) = cos(x)$ and $g(x) = x^3 + 5x$.

    The second factor happens to be the derivative of $g$: $g'(x) = 3x^2 + 5$.

    And we know the primitive of $cos$, so we have $F(x) = sin(x)$.

2.  Thus we can rewrite the function in a form that is precisely the result of the chain rule for differentiation:

    $$
    F'(g(x))*g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}F(g(x))
    $$

    Thus it is equal to the derivative of $F(g(x))$ and is therefore the primitive function for $f$.

3.  Thus the integral is equal to $F(g(x)) + C$:

    $$
    F(g(x)) + C = sin(x^3 + 5x) + C
    $$

Now consider the same with substitution:

$$
\begin{align}
u &= x^3 + 5x \\
\frac{du}{dx} &= 3x^2 + 5 \Longrightarrow du = (3x^2+5)dx \\
\int cos(x^3 + 5x) * (3x^2 + 5)dx &= \int cos(u)du \\
&= sin(u) + C \\
&= sin(x^3 + 5x) + C
\end{align}
$$

## Substitution with Bounded Intervals

Consider $\int_1^2 2xe^{3+x^2}dx$.

We *can* calculate the indefinite integral to find an antiderivative:

1.  Use substitution, $u = 3 + x^2$
2.  Then, $du = 2x dx$
3.  Then, rewrite integral as $\int e^udu$
4.  This is equal to $e^u + C$
5.  In terms of $x$, we get $e^{3+x^2} + C$
6.  Plug the boundaries into this antiderivative: $\left[e^{3+x^2}\right]_1^2 = e^7 - e^4$

But there is an easier way!

1.  Rewrite integral as usual, but for the boundaries: $\int_?^? 2xe^{3+x^2}dx$
2.  Calculate new boundaries - in this case, $3 + 1^2$ and $3 + 2^2$.
3.  Finish integral with new boundaries: $\int_4^7 e^udu = \left[e^u\right]_4^7 = e^7 - e^4$

Caution though: After substitution, boundaries may be in the wrong order. For example, consider:

1.  $\int_0^\pi(cos(x))^2sin(x)dx$
2.  Substitute $u = cos(x)$
3.  Then, $du = -sin(x)dx$ and $-du = sin(x)dx$
4.  Then for the original boundaries, $x = 0 \Rightarrow u = 1$ and $x = \pi \Rightarrow u = -1$.
5.  Then we have $\int_1^{-1}-u^2du$. I.e., $u^2 = cos(x)^2$ and $-du = sin(x)dx$
6.  We can negate the integral and reverse the boundaries: $-\int_{-1}^1 -u^2du$
7.  In this case, two minus signs cancel: $\int_{-1}^1 u^2du$
8.  This is easily evaluated with its primitive: $\left[\frac{1}{3}u^3\right]_{-1}^1 = \frac{2}{3}$

## Integration by Parts

Another major technique for calculating integrals is by parts - such as for the integral of the product of two functions, e.g. $\int (3x+4)cos(x)dx$ and $\int xe^{4x}dx$.

Unlike the product rule for differentiation, this method does not lead directly to a solution, only a simpler integral.

Recalling, the differentiation product rule is $[fg]' = f'g + fg'$.

So for example, we have $[(3x+4)sin(x)]' = 3sin(x) + (3x+4)cos(x)$.

We can use this observation to calculate a primitive function.

1.  Rewrite the relationship:

    $(3x+4)cos(x) = [(3x+4)sin(x)]' - 3sin(x)$

2.  Write as integrals:

    $\int (3x+4)cos(x)dx = \int [(3x+4)sin(x)]'dx - \int 3sin(x)dx$

3.  Knowing that a primitive function of a derivative equals the original function, so:

    $\int(3x+4)cos(x)dx = (3x+4)sin(x) - \int 3sin(x)dx$

4.  And in this case, we know the primitive for sin, so:

    $\int(3x+4)cos(x)dx = (3x+4)sin(x) - 3cos(x) + C$

In general, we have a primitive function $F$ for a function $f$ such that $F' = f$.

We can then represent the product rule as $[Fg]' = F'g + Fg' = fg + Fg'$.

We can rearrange that as $fg = [Fg]' - Fg'$.

Integration then gives $\int fgdx = \int [Fg]'dx - \int Fg'dx$.

Again, primitive of derivative is the original function, so $\int fgdx = Fg - \int Fg'dx$.

Applying this to the earlier example:

$$
\begin{align}
\int (3x+4)cos(x)dx &\Rightarrow f(x) = cos(x), F(x) = sin(x) \\
&\Rightarrow g(x) = 3x+4, g'(x) = 3 \\
&= (3x+4)sin(x) - \int 3sin(x)dx \\
&= (3x+4)sin(x) + 3cos(x) + C
\end{align}
$$

Another example, $\int xe^{4x}dx$. Which of the two functions, $x$ and $e^{4x}$, shall we integrate and which shall we differentiate?

$$
\begin{align}
\text{differentiate} &\Longleftarrow ? \Longrightarrow \text{integrate} \\
1 &\Longleftarrow x \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{2}x^2 \\
4e^{4x} &\Longleftarrow e^{4x} \Longrightarrow \frac{1}{4}e^{4x}
\end{align}
$$

Differentiating $x$ as 1 is simplest, so we say $f(x) = e^{4x}$ and $g(x) = x$, thus $g'(x) = 1$.

Then, applying the parts ($g' = 1$, $F = \frac{1}{4}e^{4x}$), we get: $\int xe^{4x}dx = \frac{1}{4}e^{4x}x - \int \frac{1}{4}e^{4x}*1dx$.

Now we calculate the final integral:

$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{4}e^{4x} * 1 dx &= \frac{1}{4}xe^{4x} - \frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{4}e^{4x} + C) \\
&= \frac{1}{4}xe^{4x} - \frac{1}{16}e^{4x} - \frac{1}{4}C
\end{align}
$$

### Tip - Choosing Parts

Integration by parts turns the problem of solving one integral into solving another, thus the goal is to make the new integral simpler than the original.

A primary decision is, which function to differentiate and which to integrate. Consider the following table. The top few entries have similar complexity in either direction. Polynomials become moderately more complicated when integrating as the degree increases by one, and slightly simpler when differentiating. Logarithms are considerably easier to differentiate.

In summary, lower on the right column suggests differentiating; while higher on the left is acceptable to integrate.

| Derivative    | Primitive |
|---------------|-----------|
| $e^x$         | $e^x$     |
| $cos(x)$      | $sin(x)$  |
| $-sin(x)$     | $cos(x)$  |
| $nx^{n-1}$    | $x^n$     |
| $\frac{1}{x}$ | $ln(x)$   |

So, for example, given $\int xsin(x)$, you'd want to differentiate $x$ and integrate $sin(x)$; while given $\int xln(x)$, you'd rather integrate $x$ and differentiate $ln(x)$.

### Tip - Creating Product, Multiplying by One

Given $\int ln(x)$, we can consider that as $\int 1*ln(x)$ and integrate the constant 1, just so we can differentiate $ln(x)$ - yielding $xln(x) - x + C$.

### Tip - Re-Integration

Consider $\int e^x cos(x)dx$. Both functions are equally challenging. Integrating $e^x$ and differentiating $cos(x)$, we can say:

$$
\begin{align}
\int e^x cos(x)dx &= e^x cos(x) + \int e^x sin(x)dx \\
&= e^x cos(x) + \left(e^x sin(x) - \int e^x * cos(x) dx \right)\\
\text{Note, latter integral equals initial one, so:}\\
2\int e^x cos(x)dx &= e^xcos(x) + e^xsin(x) \\
\int e^x cos(x)dx &= \frac{1}{2}(e^x cos(x) + e^x sin(x)) + C
\end{align}
$$

## Common Antiderivatives

Always add "$+C$" because the derivative of any constant is zero.

-   Power rule: $\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$
    -   Power of $x$: $\int a^xdx = \frac{a^x}{ln(a)} + C$
-   Exponential: $\int e^xdx = e^x + C$
-   Logarithm: $\int\frac{a}{x} = a*ln|x| + C$
-   Trigonometric: $\int cos(x)dx = sin(x) +C$, $\int sin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C$
-   Quotient: $\int \frac{1}{x^n}dx = -\frac{1}{(n-1)*x^{n-1}}$

## Working Examples

### Integral of Sum

Here we look at $4x^3 - 3x^2$.

$$
\begin{align}
\int_1^2 4x^3 - 3x^2 dx &= \int_1^2 4x^3dx + \int_1^2-3x^2dx \\
&= 4\int_1^2dx - 3\int_1^2x^dx \\
\text{Knowing that } \int x^n &= \frac{1}{n+1}x^{n+1} \text{, we have:} \\
&= 4\left[\frac{1}{4}x^4\right]_1^2 - 3\left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_1^2 \\
\text{Evaluating both at boundaries:}\\
&= 4\left(\frac{16}{4}-\frac{1}{4}\right) - 3\left(\frac{8}{3}-\frac{1}{3}\right) \\
&= 15 - 7 = 8 \\
\text{Which could be written directly as:}\\
\int 4x^3-3x^2 dx = x^4-x^3 + C
\end{align}
$$

### Piecewise Function

Consider $\int_{-1}^2|x|dx$. The absolute function is piecewise, with $x=x$ for positive values and $x = -x$ for negative values. To evaluate the integral, we can split it and sum the two.

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{-1}^2|x|dx &= \int_{-1}^0|x|dx + \int_0^2|x|dx \\\\
&= \int_{-1}^0 -xdx + \int_0^2 xdx \\\\
&= \left[-\frac{1}{2}x^2\right]_{-1}^0 + \left[\frac{1}{2}x^2\right]_0^2 \\\\
&= \left(-\frac{1}{2}0^2 - -\frac{1}{2}(-1)^2\right) + 
   \left(\frac{1}{2}2^2 - \frac{1}{2}0^2\right) \\\\
&= \frac{5}{2}
\end{align}
$$

## Substitution Method

Consider $\int \frac{1}{1+x^3}*x^2dx$.

Consider the first factor as a composition of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ and $g(x) = 1 + x^3$.

Now try substituting $u$ for $1 + x^3$. We know $\frac{du}{dx} = 3x^2$, and therefore $du = 3x^2dx$.

$x^2$ occurs in the interval, but without the multiplier of 3; so we can write $\frac{1}{3}du = x^2dx$.

Now we can express the interval as:

$$
\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{u}*\frac{1}{3}du &= \frac{1}{3}ln|u| + C \\
&= \frac{1}{3}ln|1+x^3| + C
\end{align}
$$

# Catch the Error

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x^2} &= \int_{-1}^1x^{-2}dx \text{ ( i.e., } \frac{1}{x^2} \Leftrightarrow x^{-2} \text{)} \\
&= \left[-x^{-1}\right]_{-1}^1 = \left[-\frac{1}{x}\right]_{-1}^1 \text{ (i.e., }\frac{d}{dx}-x^{-1} = x^{-2} \text{)} \\
&= \left(-\frac{1}{1}\right)-\left(-\frac{1}{-1}\right) = -1-1 \\
&= -2
\end{align}
$$

But, $\frac{1}{x^2}$ is necessarily positive, so the integral should be as well.

The problem is that $\frac{1}{x^2}$ is NOT continuous for $[-1,1]$, as $\frac{1}{0^2}$ is not defined. Integrals of such unbounded functions are "improper" integrals and must be treated differently.

## Exercises

1.  Evaluate $\int_1^3(2x-3)dx$

    $$
    \text{Primitive:}\\
    x^2 - 3x \\
    \text{Evaluated at boundaries:}\\
    (3^2 - 3*3) - (1^2 -3*1) = 2
    $$

    Correct; and geometrically, this is a 2x4 triangle. Given solution:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_1^3(2x-3)dx &= 2\int_1^3xdx - 3\int_1^31dx \\\\
    &= 2\left[\frac{1}{2}x^2\right]_1^3 - 3\left[x\right]_1^3 \\\\
    &= 2\left(\frac{9}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\right) - 3(3-1) = 2
    \end{align}
    $$

2.  Find antiderivative $F(x)$ of $f(x) = 3e^x + 5cos(x)$ such that $F(0) = 0$

3.  Evaluate $f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & x\leq 1 \\[2.5mm] x^2 & x>1\end{cases}$for $(0,2)$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_0^2 f(x)dx &= \int_0^1 0dx + \int_1^2 x^2dx \\\\
    &= 0 + \left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_1^2 \\\\
    &= \frac{8}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{3}
    \end{align}
    $$

4.  What is the TOTAL area between the graph of $f(x) = (x+1)(x-1)(x+2)$ and the x-axis for $x = (-2,1)$?

    Phew, on the 5th try. First, I wrongly assumed the split was at 0; but plotting shows positive area for $(-2,-1)$ and negative for $(-1,0)$.

5.  What is the primitive function $F(x)$ of $f(x) = cos(2x)$ such that $F(0) = 0$?

    $sin(x^2) * 2x$ (wrong?!)

    $\frac{1}{2}sin(2x)$

6.  Primitive function $G(x)$ of $f(x) = cos(x+5)$ such that $G(-5) = 0$?

    $sin(x+5)$

7.  Primitive function $H(x)$ of $h(x) = cos(2x+5)$ such that $H(-5/2) = 0$?

    $\frac{1}{2}sin(2x+5)$

8.  Evaluate $\int_3^5 \frac{1}{2x+3}dx$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \text{Primitive} &: \frac{1}{2}ln(2x+3) \\
    \text{Evaluate} &: \frac{1}{2}(ln(13)-ln(9))

9.  Given $\int x^2\sqrt{1+x^3}dx$, rewrite as $\int f(u)du$ with $u = 1 + x^3$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= 1 + x^3 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 3x^2 \\
    du &= 3x^2dx \\
    \frac{1}{3}du &= x^2dx \\
    \text{Thus,}\\
    f(u) &= \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{u}
    \end{align}
    $$

10. Find anti-derivative of $F(x) = \int x^2 \sqrt{1+x^3}dx$, such that $F(0) = \frac{2}{9}$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{du}{dx}\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{u} &= \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{u}^{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}(1+x^3)^{\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{1}{9} \text{ (Wrong)} \\
    \frac{du}{dx}\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{u} &= \frac{1}{6}\sqrt{u}^2 = \frac{u}{6} = \frac{1+x^3}{6} + \frac{1}{18} \text{ (Wrong)} \\
    \frac{du}{dx}\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{u} &= \frac{1}{3}u^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}*\frac{u^{\frac{3}{2}}}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}*\frac{2}{3}*u^{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{2}{9}u^{\frac{3}{2}} \text{ (Correct)}
    \end{align}
    $$

11. Given $\int \frac{(ln(x))^5}{x}dx$, use $u = ln(x)$ to rewrite as $\int f(u)du$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= ln(x) \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{1}{x} \\
    du &= \frac{1}{x}dx \\

12. Find antiderivative of $\int \frac{(ln(x))^5}{x}dx$ such that $F(1) = 0$.

    $$
    \frac{du}{dx}u^5 = \frac{1}{6}u^6 = \frac{1}{6}ln(x)^6
    $$

13. Find antiderivative $F(x) = \int \frac{cos(\sqrt{x})}{\sqrt{x})}dx$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= \sqrt{x} \\
    \int \frac{cos(\sqrt{x})}{\sqrt{x}}dx \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{1}{2*\sqrt{u}} \\
    du &= \frac{1}{2*\sqrt{u}}dx \\
    \frac{sin(\sqrt{x})}{2*\sqrt{x}} \text{ (Wrong)} \\\\
    \text{Figured it out by trial and error:}\\
    2sin(\sqrt{x})
    \end{align}
    $$

    I was on the right path above. The given solution:

    Substitute with $u = \sqrt{x}$, and thus $du = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$, which can be written as $2du = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$. (Note, I had $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{u}}$...)

    Then rewrite integral as, $\int \frac{cos(\sqrt{x})}{\sqrt{x}}dx = \int 2cos(u)du = 2sin(u) + C = 2sin(\sqrt{x}) + C$. And since $F(0) = 0$, $C=0$.

14. Consider $\int_1^2 \frac{4x^3}{3+x^4}dx$. Use $u = 3+x^4$ and rewrite as $\int_a^bf(u)du$, with $a<b$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= 3 + x^4 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 4x^3 \\
    du &= 4x^3dx \\
    \int_1^2\frac{4x^3}{3+x^4}dx &= \int \frac{du}{u} = \int_4^{19} \frac{1}{u}du
    \end{align}
    $$

15. Evaluate the integral from #14.

    $\frac{1}{19} - \frac{1}{4}$ (Wrong)

    Antiderivative: $\frac{1}{u} \Rightarrow ln(u) + C$

    Thus? $ln(19) - ln(4)$ (Correct)

16. Consider $\int_1^4 \frac{e^{\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2}dx$. Substitute $u = \frac{1}{x}$ and rewrite as $\int_a^b f(u)du$, with $a < b$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= \frac{1}{x} = x^{-1} \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= -1x^{-2} = -\frac{1}{x^2} \\
    du &= -\frac{dx}{x^2} \\
    \int \frac{e^{\frac{1}{x}}}{x^2}dx &= \int_{1}^{\frac{1}{4}} -e^udu \\
    &= -\int_{\frac{1}{4}}^1-e^udu \\
    &= \int_{\frac{1}{4}}^1e^udu
    \end{align}
    $$

    Note, first submission I had the function correct but evaluated $a$ and $b$ through the function, rather than $u$.

17. Evaluate the integral in #16.

    Antiderivative: $e^u \Rightarrow e^u + C$

    Thus, $e^1 - e^{\frac{1}{4}}$

18. Consider $\int_a^b f(cx+d)dx$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are constants and $c \ne 0$. Substitute $u = cx + d$ and rewrite.

    Knowing $\int_a^b f(x+C) \Rightarrow \int_{a+C}^{b+C} f(x)$ and $\int_a^b f(Cx) \Rightarrow \int_{aC}^{bC}\frac{1}{C}f(x)$, we have:

    $\int_{ac+d}^{bc+d} \frac{1}{c}f(x)$

19. Solve $F(x) = \int x sin(3x) dx$ such that $F(0) = 0$.

    This one took me awhile. I was close, but overlooked moving $\frac{1}{3}$ out of the final integral.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int x sin(3x)dx \\
    f(x) &= sin(3x) \Longrightarrow F(x) = -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x) \\
    g(x) &= x \Longrightarrow g'(x) = 1 \\
    Fg - \int Fg'dx &= -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)x - \int -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)dx \\
    &= -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)x + \frac{1}{3} \int(cos3x)dx \\
    &= -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)x + \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}sin(3x)\right) \\
    &= -\frac{1}{3}cos(3x)x + \frac{1}{9}sin(3x) + C
    \end{align}
    $$

20. Find the integral $\int_1^e \sqrt{x}ln(x)dx$. Differentiate $ln(x)$ and integrate $\sqrt{x}$.

    Struggled with this one too - goofed! Was taking *derivative* of final integral, not primitive!

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_1^e \sqrt{x}*ln(x)dx \\
    f(x) &= \sqrt{x} \Longrightarrow F(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}\\
    g(x) &= ln(x) \Longrightarrow g'(x) = \frac{1}{x} \\
    Fg - \int Fg'dx &= \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(x) - \int \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}\frac{1}{x} \\
    &= \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(x) - \frac{2}{3}\int x^{\frac{3}{2}}\frac{1}{x} \\
    &= \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(x) - \frac{2}{3}\frac{2x\sqrt{x}}{3} \\
    &= \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(x) - \frac{4x\sqrt{x}}{9}\\
    \text{Evaluate boundaries: }\\
    \left(\frac{2}{3}e^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(e) - \frac{4e\sqrt{e}}{9}\right) - \\
    \left(\frac{2}{3}1^{\frac{3}{2}}ln(1) - \frac{4*1\sqrt{1}}{9}\right) &= 1.440375
    \end{align}
    $$

21. Integrate by parts to find primitive function for $\int x^2cos(2x)dx$.

    I struggled mightily on this one until "switching parts".

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int x^2cos(2x)dx \\
    f(x) &= cos(2x) \\
    F(x) &= \frac{1}{2}sin(2x) \\
    g(x) &= x^2 \\
    g'(x) &= 2x \\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)x^2 - \int \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)2x \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)x^2 - \int x*sin(2x) \\
    f_2(x) &= sin(2x) \\
    F_2(x) &= -\frac{1}{2}cos(2x) \\
    g_2(x) &= x \\
    g_2'(x) &= 1 \\
    &\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)x^2 - \left( -\frac{1}{2}cos(2x)x - \int -\frac{1}{2}cos(2x)*1 \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)x^2 + \frac{1}{2}cos(2x)x - \frac{1}{2}\int cos(2x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\left(sin(2x)x^2 + cos(2x)x - \frac{1}{2}sin(2x)\right)
    \end{align}
    $$

22. Integrate by parts to evaluate $\int_1^eln(x)^2dx$

    Flailed on this one too, taking *derivative* rather than primitive...

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_1^e ln(x)^2dx &= \int_1^e 1*ln(x)^2dx \\
    f(x) &= 1 \\
    F(x) &= x \\
    g(x) &= ln(x)^2 \\
    g'(x) &= \frac{2ln(x)}{x} \\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= xln(x)^2 - \int x \frac{2ln(x)}{x} \\
    &= xln(x)^2 - 2\int ln(x) \\
    &= xln(x)^2 - 2(ln(x)x-x) \\
    \text{Evaluating boundaries:}\\
    \left(eln(e)^2 - 2(ln(e)e-e)\right) - \left(1ln(1)^2 - 2(1ln(1)-1)\right) &= 0.7182818
    \end{align}
    $$

23. Calculate $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} e^{3x}sin(2x)dx$

    I was so close for so long on this one. My mistake was moving $-\frac{4}{9}$ to the left for $\frac{13}{9}$ - but using that on the right side, rather than the reciprocal!

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int e^{3x}sin(2x)dx \\
    Fg - \int Fg' \\
    f(x) &= e^{3x} \\
    F(x) &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x} \\
    g(x) &= sin(2x) \\
    g'(x) &= 2cos(2x) \\
    \int e^{3x}sin(2x)dx &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \int \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}2cos(2x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{3}\int e^{3x}cos(2x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}e^{3x}cos(2x) - \int \frac{1}{3}e^{3x} * -2sin(2x) \right)\\
    &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}e^{3x}cos(2x) + \frac{2}{3} \int e^{3x}sin(2x) \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{9}e^{3x}cos(2x) - \frac{4}{9} \int e^{3x}sin(2x) \\
    &\Rightarrow \frac{9}{13}\left( \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{9}e^{3x}cos(2x)\right) \\
    &= \frac{9}{39}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{18}{117}cos(2x) \\
    &= \frac{3}{13}e^{3x}sin(2x) - \frac{2}{13}e^{3x}cos(2x) \\
    \text{Evaluate boundaries:} \\
    \left(\frac{3}{13}e^{3\pi/2}sin(2\pi/2) - \frac{2}{13}e^{3\pi/2}cos(2\pi/2)\right) - \\
    \left(\frac{3}{13}e^{3*0}sin(2*0) - \frac{2}{13}e^{3*0}cos(2*0)\right) &= 17.27966
    \end{align}
    $$

# Training Sequence

1.  Graph is given with $(0,-1),(1,0),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,2)$. What is the integral $\int_0^5f(x)dx$?

    I was unsure what was being asked, and took and educated guess $3.5$ (three full squares and two halves above the x-axis, and one half below.) Correct.

2.  Another graph, a downward slope including points $(0,3), (3,0), (7,-1)$. Arrange the following integrals of $f(x)dx$ from large to small: $\int_0^3$ (all positive), $\int_0^5$ (mostly positive), $\int_0^7$ (more positive than the last), $\int_2^7$.

3.  $\int_0^1 e^{-x^2}$ is approximately equal to $-0.50$, $0.25$, $0.75$, $1.46$. Approximate with Riemann sum.

    Is that $e^{-(x^2)}$ or $e^{(-x^2)}$? The latter is silly in that it becomes positive when squared... So I guessed $e^{-(.5^2)} \approx 0.7788$.

4.  $\int_1^4 \frac{\sqrt{x^2+1}}{x}$ is approximately equal to $1.21$, $2.17$, $3.34$, $4.19$?

    Huh. I did the following for $4.93$:

    ```{r}
    sum(sapply(seq(1,4,2), function(x) { h <- sqrt(x^2+1)/x; 2*h}))
    ```

    Then I checked manually, each value gives $1+$. Plotted it; calculated max ($\frac{\sqrt{1^2+1}}{1} \approx 1.414$) and min ($\frac{\sqrt{4^2+1}}{4} \approx 1.03$) Multiplied by length of interval for a range of $3.09-4.24$. Was already wrong with $4.19$, so $3.34$. (Ah, used `sapply` as if the interval was of length 4.)

5.  If $\int_1^5 f(x)dx = 5$ and $\int_1^3f(x)dx = 8$, then $\int_3^5f(x) = ?$

    $-3$, obviously.

6.  If $\int_2^8 f(x)dx = 6$, then $\int_1^4f(2x)dx = ?$

    This is a scaled linear function, so $\int_a^b f(2x) = \int_{2a}^{2b} \frac{1}{2}f(x)$. All is there in the formula but the half, so $3$.

7.  Evaluate $\int_\pi^{\frac{\pi}{2}}cos(x)dx$.

    Backwards interval, so:

    $-\left[sin(x)\right]_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^\pi = 1$

8.  Evaluate $\int_2^2e^{x^2}$

    Huh, zero-length interval - zero? Yep.

9.  Evaluate $\int_1^{12}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x+6}$

    Plotted, this is linear from $(1,2.5)$ to $(12, 3)$ - so it would seem the area is $\frac{1}{2}11*\frac{1}{2} = 2.75$, but that is wrong...

    ```{r}
    data.frame(x=seq(1,12,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y = sqrt((x/4)+6)))  + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,12,1)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2,3,.5))
    ```

    Substitution method. I needed additional guidance; was on the right path but was unsure about the treatment of $4du$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_1^{12}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x + 6} dx \\
    u &= \frac{1}{4}x + 6 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{1}{4} \\
    du &= \frac{1}{4}dx \\
    4du &= dx \\
    \int_1^{12}4\sqrt{u} &= 4\int_1^{12}\sqrt{u} \\
    &= 4 * \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}} \\
    &= 4 * \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}x + 6\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \\
    &= \frac{8}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}x + 6\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \\\\
    \left[ \frac{8}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}x + 6\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right]_1^{12} = 72-41\frac{2}{3} &= 30\frac{1}{3}
    \end{align}
    $$

    Given solution is neat - for the bounded interval:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_1^{12}\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}x+6}dx 
    &= 4\int_{\frac{1}{4}}^3\sqrt{x+6}dx \\
    &= 4\int_{\frac{25}{4}}^9\sqrt{x}dx \\
    &= 4\left[\frac{2}{3}x\sqrt{x}\right]_{\frac{25}{4}}^9 \\
    &= 4\left(\frac{54}{3} - \frac{125}{12}\right) = \frac{91}{3}
    \end{align}
    $$

10. Evaluate $\int_2^4e^x*e^x$

    Intriguing that this isn't $e^{2x}$.

    Since $e^x \Leftrightarrow e^x$, I assumed $e^8-e^4$, but that was wrong...

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_2^4 e^x*e^x \\
    f &= e^x \\
    F &= e^x \\
    g &= e^x \\
    g' &= e^x \\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= e^xe^x - \int e^xe^x \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}(e^xe^x)
    \end{align}
    $$

    That IS correct; but solution is simpler:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_2^4 e^xe^x &= \int_2^4 e^{2x} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\int_4^8 e^x \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\left[e^x\right]_4^8 \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\left(e^8-e^4\right)
    \end{align}
    $$

11. Find primitive of $sin\left(\frac{2}{3}x-3\right)$ such that $F\left(\frac{9}{2}\right) = 1$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= \frac{2}{3}x -3 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{2}{3} \\
    du &= \frac{2}{3}dx \\
    \frac{3}{2}du &= dx \\
    \int sin\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 3\right)dx &= \int \frac{3}{2}sin(u) \\
    &= \frac{3}{2}\int sin(u) \\
    &= -\frac{3}{2}cos(u) \\
    &= -\frac{3}{2}cos\left(\frac{2}{3}x-3\right) + C \Rightarrow C=2.5
    \end{align}
    $$

12. Find primitive of $\frac{3}{(5x-2)^3}$ such that $F(1) = 0$.

    Needed guidance on this one too. I spent a lot of time substituting for $(5x-2)^3$. In the final solution, I made a mistake with $\frac{3}{2}\int$ - when the anti-derivative was negative, I ended up with $\frac{3}{2} - ?$ rather than $\frac{3}{2} * -?$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= 5x -2 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 5 \\
    du &= 5dx \\
    \frac{1}{5}du &= dx \\
    \int \frac{3}{(5x-2)^3}dx &= \int \frac{3}{5u^3} \\
    &= \frac{3}{5}\int \frac{1}{u^3} \\
    &= \frac{3}{5}\int u^{-3} \\
    &= \frac{3}{5} * -\frac{1}{2}u^{-2} \\
    &= \frac{3}{5} * -\frac{1}{2u^2} \\
    &= \frac{3}{5} * -\frac{1}{2(5x-2)^2} \\
    &= -\frac{3}{10(5x-2)^2} + C \Rightarrow C = \frac{1}{30}
    \end{align}
    $$

13. Evaluate $\int_0^6 \frac{1}{x+2}dx$

    I *thought* this, but only submitted given five chances (correct!):

    $$
    \int_2^8 \frac{1}{x} = \left[ln(x)\right]_2^8 = ln(8)-ln(2)
    $$

14. With $k>0$, what is the value of $\int_k^{3k}\frac{1}{x}dx$?

    I had the formula correct immediately but paused on how to answer it without knowing $k$. Experimentally I realized that any $ln(3x)-ln(x) = ln(3)$. The given solution indicates that $ln(3k)-ln(k) = ln\left(\frac{3k}{k}\right) = ln(3)$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_k^{3k}\frac{1}{x}dx &= \left[ln(x)\right]_k^{3k} = ln(3)
    \end{align}
    $$

15. What is the primitive for $cos(x)sin(x)$ such that $F\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)= 0$?

    Goofed slightly, had $g' = -cos(x)$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int cos(x)sin(x) \\
    f &= cos(x) \\
    F &= sin(x) \\
    g &= sin(x) \\
    g' &= cos(x) \\
    \int cos(x)sin(x) &= Fg - \int Fg' \\
    &= sin(x)sin(x) - \int sin(x)cos(x) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}sin(x)^2 + C \Rightarrow C = -\frac{1}{4}
    \end{align}
    $$

16. Anti-derivative of $\frac{1}{x\sqrt{x-x^2}}$?

    I tried to differentiate all of these, using product quotient rules. Was definitely far astray on the correct answer.

    i.  $2ln(x\sqrt{x-x^2})\frac{2\sqrt{x-x^2}}{2+x-2x^2}$

    ii. $\frac{ln(x)}{2\sqrt{x-x^2}}$

    iii. $-\frac{2\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x}$

         $$
         \begin{align}
         \frac{d}{dx}\frac{-2\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x} &= \frac{2\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x^2}-\frac{2}{x}\frac{1-2x}{2\sqrt{x-x^2}} \\
         &= \frac{2(x-x^2)-x(1-2x)}{x^2\sqrt{x-x^2}} \\
         &= \frac{x}{x^2\sqrt{x-x^2}} \\
         &= \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x-x^2}}
         \end{align}
         $$

    iv. $\sqrt{\frac{1-x}{x}}$

17. We've seen that $\frac{d}{dx}ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$. Use that to evaluate $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}dx$.

    $$
    \left[ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})\right]_0^1 = ln(\sqrt{2}+1)
    $$

18. Derivative of $xln(x)$

    Product rule, $f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$

    $1*ln(x) + x*\frac{1}{x} = ln(x) + 1$

19. Evaluate $\int_1^2(ln(x)+1)dx$

    $$
    \left[xln(x)\right]_1^2 = (2*ln(2))-ln(1) = 2*ln(2)
    $$

20. Evaluate $\int_1^2ln(x)dx$

    Was wrong initially, without the outer parens...

    $$
    \left[xln(x)-x\right]_1^2 = (2ln(2)-2) - (1ln(1)-1)
    $$

21. Find the max value of the antiderivative of $\frac{-x}{x^2+1}$

    I struggled to get a primitive via parts (the resulting quadratic integral kept getting more complex!), then researched and realized substitution. In the end though: The result will always be negative(\*) due to $-x$ and the squaring; thus zero is largest...

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int \frac{-x}{x^2+1}dx \\
    u &= x^2 + 1 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 2x \\
    du &= 2xdx \\
    \frac{1}{2}du &= xdx \\
    \int \frac{-x}{x^2+1}dx &= \int -\frac{1}{2u}du \\
    &= -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u}du \\
    &= -\frac{1}{2} ln(u) \\
    &= -\frac{ln(x^2+1)}{2} + C
    \end{align}
    $$

22. Find the area between the graphs for $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$:

    ![](images/clipboard-1554715012.png){width="122"}

    That should be the area under $g$ minus the area under $f$.

    $$
    G(x) = \int_0^1 \sqrt{x} = \left[\frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}}\right]_0^1 = \frac{2}{3}\\
    F(x) = \int_0^1 x^2 = \left[\frac{1}{3}x^3\right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}
    $$

23. Find area enclosed by $f(x) = e^{2x} -1$, the x-axis, and $x=2$.

    Plotting, I see that $y$ and $x$ have the same sign - i.e., there is positive area for $x$ in $[0,2]$ and negative area for $x$ in $[-\infty, 0]$. Based on the wording of the question, that should equal the interval for $[0,2]$.

    $$
    F(x) = \int_0^2 e^{2x} -1 = \left[ \frac{e^{2x}}{2}-x \right]_0^2 = \left(\frac{e^4}{2}-2\right)-\frac{e^0}{2} = \frac{e^4-e^0}{2}-2
    $$

24. Area between $f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 3$ for the interval $[-1,2]$

    ![](images/clipboard-2501936234.png){width="160"}

    I confirmed that the graph is honest - the functions are equal for $x$ in $(-1,1,2)$. So, this looks like $\int_{-1}^1 G-F + \int_1^a F-G + |\int_a^2 F-G|$, with $a$ TBD.

    When are $f$ and $g$ zero? Both seem impossible (irrational?) Maybe I don't need to know - just consider total area of each?

    $$
    f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x + 1 \\
    f'(x) = 4x^3 - 9x^2 + 2 \\
    g(x) = x^4 -2x^3 -2x^2 + x + 3 \\
    g'(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 1
    $$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    F(x) &= \int x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x + 1 \\
    &= \left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{3}{4}x^4 + x^2 + x\right] \\\\
    G(x) &= \int x^4 -2x^3 -2x^2 + x + 3 \\
    &= \left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{2}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2  + 3x\right] \\\\
    \int_{-1}^1 G - F + \int_1^2 F-G &= \left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{2}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x\right]_{-1}^1 \\
    &- \left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{3}{4}x^4 + x^2 + x\right]_{-1}^1 \\
    &+ \left|\left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{3}{4}x^4 + x^2 + x\right]_1^2\right| \\
    &- \left|\left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 - \frac{2}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x \right]_1^2\right|
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    f <- function(x) { x^4 - 3*x^3 + 2*x + 1 }
    g <- function(x) { x^4 - 2*x^3 -2*x^2 + x + 3 }
    data.frame(x=seq(-1,2,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y = f(x))) + geom_line(aes(color='red', y = g(x)))
    ```

    ```{r}
    G <- function(x) { (1/5)*x^5 - (2/4)*x^4 - (2/3)*x^3 + (1/2)*x^2 + 3*x }
    F <- function(x) { (1/5)*x^5 - (3/4)*x^4 + x^2 + x }

    ((G(1)-G(-1))-(F(1)-F(-1))) + (abs(F(2)-F(1))-abs(G(2)-G(1))) # 2.25 (Wrong)
    ((G(1)-G(-1))-(F(1)-F(-1))) + abs(abs(F(2)-F(1))-abs(G(2)-G(1))) # Correct!
    ```

    Given explanation - solve for $f(x)-g(x)=0$:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    f(x) - g(x) &= -x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 2 \\
    &= (x-2)(-x^2 + 1) \\
    &= -(x-2)(x-1)(x+1) \Rightarrow (-1,1,2) \\
    \text{Now, awesome, primitive of the difference:}\\
    \int_{-1}^2 |f(x)-g(x)| &= 
    \left[\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x\right]_{-1}^1 \\
    &+ \left[-\frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{2}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 2x\right]_1^2 \\
    &= \left(\frac{13}{12}-\left(-\frac{19}{12}\right)\right) + \left(-\frac{2}{3}-\left(-\frac{13}{12}\right)\right) = \frac{37}{12}
    \end{align}
    $$

25. Consider $cosh(x) = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$ and $sinh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$. Then it is easily(?) seen that $cosh'(x) = sinh(x)$ and $sinh'(x) = cosh(x)$.

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    e <- exp(1)
    data.frame(x = seq(-1,1,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y=( e^x + e^(-x) )/2 )) + geom_hline(yintercept = (e^1 + e^(-1))/2, linetype = 'dashed') + geom_vline(xintercept = c(-1,1), linetype = 'dashed')
    ```

    Above is $cosh(x)$ for $[-1,1]$. Compute indicated area, of the graph and horizontal line crossing the endpoints.

    Hmm, first identify horizontal line, which would be $y = \frac{e^1+e^{-1}}{2} = 1.543081$.

    Now, the width of the rectangle is 2, so area is $2*\frac{e^1 + e^{-1}}{2} = e^1+e^{-1} = 3.086161$.

    Thus highlighted area is $e^1 + e^{-1} - \int_{-1}^1cosh(x)$.

    Primitive of $\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{1}{2}\int e^x + e^{-x} &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\int e^x + \int\frac{1}{e^x}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\left(e^x + \int\frac{1}{e^x}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\left(e^x - \frac{1}{e^x}\right) \\
    &= \frac{e^x}{2} - \frac{1}{2e^x}
    \end{align}
    $$

    Thus, $e^1 + e^{-1} - \left[\frac{e^x}{2}-\frac{1}{2e^x} \right]_{-1}^1$

    ```{r}
    e <- exp(1)
    F <- function(x) { (e^x)/2 - 1/(2*(e^x)) }
    A <- e^1 + e^(-1)
    A - ( F(1) - F(-1) )
    ```

26. Consider $f(x) = \frac{1}{x+1}$ and some value $p$ in the interval $[0,3]$. Let $A$ be the area under the graph of $f$ between $x=0$ and $x=p$; and let $B$ be the area under the graph of $f$ between $x=p$ and $x=3$. What is $p$ such that $A=B$?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int \frac{1}{x+1} &= \left[ ln(x+1) \right]_0^3 \\
    &= log(4)-log(1) = 1.386294 \\
    \text{Just by chance...} \\
    log(2)-log(1) &== log(4)-log(2)
    \end{align}
    $$

    Given explanation:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    A &= \int_0^p \frac{1}{x+1} = \left[ln(x+1)\right]_0^p = ln(p+1)-ln(1) = ln(p+1) \\
    B &= \int_p^3 \frac{1}{x+1} = \left[ln(x+1)\right]_p^3 = ln(3+1)-ln(p+1) = ln(4)-ln(p+1) \\
    \text{Thus, } A=B \text{ when}\\
    ln(p+1) &= ln(4) - ln(p+1) \Rightarrow \\
    2ln(p+1) &=ln(4) \Rightarrow \\
    ln(p+1) &= \frac{1}{2}ln(4) = ln(2) = 1
    \end{align}
    $$

27. Evaluate $\int_0^1(x^2 + 2x + 3)e^{2x}$

    Initially, I tried the reverse of $f$ and $g$ below and seemed to dead-end. Then I was on course but when solving the final integral, forgot to add back the original.

    Note, the given solution looks vastly different. One thing done different is to actually evaluate the primitives when identified. E.g., $\int_0^1(x^2+2x+3)e^{2x} = \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + 2x + 3) - \int \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(2x+2) = \left[(x^2 + 2x +3)\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}\right]_0^1 - \int ...$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    g &= (x^2 + 2x + 3) \\
    g' &= 2x + 2 \\
    f &= e^{2x} \\
    f' &= 2e^{2x} \\
    F &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x} \\
    \int_0^1(x^2+2x+3)e^{2x} &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + 2x + 3) - \int \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(2x+2) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + 2x + 3) - \int \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}2(x+1) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + 2x + 3) - \int e^{2x}(x+1) \\
    \\
    f_2 &= f \\
    F_2 &= F \\
    g_2 &= x + 1 \\
    g_2' &= 1 \\
    \int e^{2x}(x+1) &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x+1) - \int \frac{1}{2}e^{2x} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x+1) - \frac{1}{4}e^{2x} \\\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x^2 + 2x + 3) - \left(\frac{1}{2}e^{2x}(x+1) - \frac{1}{4}e^{2x}\right)
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    e <- exp(1)
    FG <- function(x) {
        (1/2)*e^(2*x)*(x^2 + 2*x + 3) -
        ( (1/2)*e^(2*x)*(x+1) - (1/4)*e^(2*x))
    }
    FG(1)-FG(0)
    ```

28. Evaluate $\int_1^2\frac{ln(x)}{x^2}$

    Try as $ln(x) * \frac{1}{x^2}$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    f &= \frac{1}{x^2} \\
    F &= -1x^{-1} = -\frac{1}{x} \\
    g &= ln(x) \\
    g' &= \frac{1}{x} \\
    \int_1^2 ln(x)*\frac{1}{x^2} &= Fg - \int Fg' \\
    &= -\frac{1}{x}ln(x) - \int -\frac{1}{x}\frac{1}{x} \\
    &= -\frac{1}{x}ln(x) + \int \frac{1}{x^2} \\
    &= -\frac{1}{x}ln(x) - \frac{1}{x} \\
    &= -\frac{ln(x)+1}{x}
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    FG <- function(x) { -(log(x)+1)/x }
    FG(2) - FG(1)
    ```

29. Substitute $u = cos(x)$ and rewrite $\int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$ as $\int f(u)du$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= cos(x) \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= -sin(x) \\
    du &= -sin(x)dx \\
    \int \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)} &= \frac{-1}{u}du
    \end{align}
    $$

30. Using previous exercise, find primitive for $tan(x)$ for $\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)$ such that $F(0)=0$

    Well, $tan(x) = \frac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$; so have $\int \frac{-1}{cos(x)}$. I pondered how to tackle that, then knowing derivative of $ln(x) = \frac{1}{x}$, I tried $log(cos(x))$ - and then negated it...

    $-ln(cos(x))$

31. Suppose density of a blade is given as $f(x) = \frac{5}{1+5x}-\frac{5}{6}$ in kg/m on the interval $[0,1]$. What is the mass of the blade?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_0^1 \frac{5}{1+5x}-\frac{5}{6} &= \int_0^1 \frac{5}{1+5x} - \int_0^1 \frac{5}{6} \\
    &= \int_0^1 \frac{5}{1+5x} - \frac{5}{6} \int_0^1 1 \\
    &= \int_0^1 \frac{5}{1+5x} - \left[\frac{5}{6}x\right]_0^1 \\
    u &= 1+5x \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 5 \\
    du &= 5dx \\
    \int_0^1 \frac{5}{1+5x} &= \frac{1}{u}du = \left[ ln(1+5x) \right]_0^1 \\\\
    {Together,} \\
    \left[ ln(1+5x) \right]_0^1 - \left[\frac{5}{6}x\right]_0^1
    &= (1.791759-0)-(5/6-0) = 0.9584257
    \end{align}

34. Length of a graph of $f(x)$ can be calculated as $L = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}dx$

    What is the length of $f(x) = x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ for $[0,5]$?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    f &= x^{\frac{3}{2}} \\
    f' &= \frac{3}{2}x^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{x}\\

35. The shape of a rope/chain with constant mass density hanging from two points hangs in the form $f(x) = cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$ (or some shifted/scaled version of that). Such a graph is called a catenary.

    Calculate the length of such a chain between points $-1$ and $1$.

    Derivative:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dx}\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dx}e^x + e^{-x} \\

36. Here we want to determine the volume of a water cooling tower.

    ![](images/clipboard-3577313071.png){width="172"}

    This is another use-case for Riemann sums - we can take ever-slimmer slices (circles) and add up the areas based on each radius. For this 35m tower, we have $r(h) = \sqrt{25 + \frac{1}{3}(h-25)^2}$ , and the area can then be calculated as $A(h) = \pi r(h)^2$. Letting the height of the slices approach zero, we find that the volume $V$ of the above 35m tower is given by $V = \int_0^{35} A(h)dh$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_{h=0}^{h=35} \pi*\left(\sqrt{25 + \frac{1}{3}(h-25)^2}\right)^2 
    &= \pi \int_{h=0}^{h=35} 25 + \frac{1}{3}(h-25)^2 \\
    &= \pi \int_{h=0}^{h=35} 25 + \frac{1}{3}(h-25)(h-25) \\
    &= \pi \int_{h=0}^{h=35} 25 + \frac{1}{3}(h^2 - 50h + 625) \\
    &= \pi \int_{h=0}^{h=35} 25 + \frac{1}{3}h^2 - \frac{50}{3}h + \frac{625}{3} \\
    &= \pi \int_{h=0}^{h=35} \frac{1}{3}h^2 - \frac{50}{3}h + \frac{700}{3} \\
    &= \pi * \left[ \frac{1}{9}h^3 - \frac{50}{6}h^2 + \frac{700}{3}h \right]_0^{35}

    (Relieved to have gotten it right on the first try; the radius formula looks suspect, with 25 and not 35?)

37. Given a probability distribution $p(x) = cx^2(1-x)$, determine $c$ such that $1 = \int_0^1p(x)dx$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    1 &= \int_0^1 cx^2(1-x) \\
    f &= x^2 \\
    F &= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \\
    g &= 1-x \\
    g' &= -1 \\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= \frac{1}{3}x^3(1-x) - \int_0^1 \frac{1}{3}x^3*-1 \\
    &= \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{3}x^4 + \int_0^1 \frac{1}{3}x^3 \\
    &= \frac{x^3 - x^4}{3} + \left[ \frac{1}{12}x^4 \right]_0^1 \\
    &= \frac{x^3 - x^4}{3} + \frac{1}{12}
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    # c <- 1  => 0.08333333 => 1/0.08333 = 12
    c <- 12
    F <- function(x) { c * ((x^3 - x^4)/3 + 1/12) }
    F(1)
    ```

38. Using #37, expected portion of sunshine is $\int_0^1 xp(x)dx$ (new $x$-multiplier to the earlier formula) - what is the value?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    1 &= \int_0^1 x*cx^2(1-x) \\
    1 &= \int_0^1 cx^3(1-x) \\
    f &= x^3 \\
    F &= \frac{1}{4}x^4 \\
    g &= 1-x \\
    g' &= -1 \\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= \frac{1}{4}x^4(1-x) - \int_0^1 \frac{1}{4}x^4*-1 \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{1}{4}x^5 + \int_0^1 \frac{1}{4}x^4 \\
    &= \frac{x^4 - x^5}{4} + \left[ \frac{1}{20}x^5 \right]_0^1 \\
    &= \frac{x^4 - x^5}{4} + \frac{1}{20}
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    c <- 12
    F <- function(x) { c * ((x^4 - x^5)/4 + 1/20) }
    F(1)
    ```

39. If you invest 100 per month and get 3% compounded each month, for 45 years, you should expect $\int_0^{540} 100 * \left(1 + \frac{.3}{100}\right)^xdx$. How much is that?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_0^{540} 100*\left(1+ \frac{.3}{100}\right)^x &= 100 \int_0^{540}1.003^x \\
    &= 100*\left[ \frac{1.003^x}{ln(1.003)}\right]_0^{540}
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    F <- function(x) { 100* (1.003^x)/log(1.003) }
    F(540) - F(0)
    ```

# Homework

1.  Easy question, a visual of a graph, asking for an approximation of the signed area ($7$)

2.  Reimann sum for $\int_0^8 = \frac{1}{4}x^2$, with four subintervals of equal length and sample points in the middle.

    ```{r}
    sum(sapply(seq(1,7,2), function(x) { h <- (1/4)*x^2; 2*h }))
    ```

3.  Same as above, but largest estimate?

    ```{r}
    sum(sapply(seq(1,7,2), function(x) { h <- (1/4)*(x+1)^2; 2*h }))
    ```

4.  For $x > -\frac{5}{2}$, find the primitive of $f(x) = \frac{1}{2x+5}$ such that $F(-\frac{3}{2}) = 0$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int \frac{1}{2x+5}dx \\
    f(x) &= \frac{1}{x} \\
    g(x) &= 2x + 5 \\
    u &= 2x + 5 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 2 \\
    \frac{1}{2}du &= dx \\
    \int \frac{1}{2x+5}dx &= \frac{1}{u} * \frac{1}{2}du \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}ln(u) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}ln(2x+5)
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    C <- -0.3465736
    F <- function(x) { (1/2)*log(abs(2*x + 5)) + C }
    F(-3/2)
    ```

5.  Find primitive of $f(x) = \frac{1}{(3x+7)^2}$ such that $F(0) = 0$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int \frac{1}{(3x+7)^2}dx \\
    u &= 3x+7 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 3 \\
    \frac{1}{3}du &= dx \\
    \int \frac{1}{3u^2}du &= \frac{1}{3}\int \frac{1}{u^2}du \\
    &= \frac{1}{3} * \left(-\frac{1}{u}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{3} * \left(-\frac{1}{3x+7}\right) \\
    &= -\frac{1}{9x + 21}
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    C <- 0.04761905
    F <- function(x) { (-1)/(9*x + 21) + C }
    F(0)
    ```

6.  Given $f(x) = 4 - x^2$, what is the value $p$ such that $(0,2)$ has the same (positive) area as $(2,p)$ has (negative)?

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_0^p 4 - x^2 &= [ 4x -\frac{1}{3}x^3 ]
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    F <- function(x) { 4*x - (1/3)*x^3 }
    F(2)-F(0)
    F(sqrt(12))-F(2)
    ```

    Ah, given explanation: When equal, they'll cancel out and the complete integral will equal zero. So, $4x - \frac{1}{3}x^3 = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{3}x(12-x^2) = 0$, and since $x>0$, $12-x^2=0$ ...

7.  Primitive of $xe^{-x^2}$

    Spent a lot of time on this with parts and substitution, each effort seemed interminable. Differentiating the third choice with the chain rule gives:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dx}\left(-\frac{1}{2}e^{-x^2}\right) &= -\frac{1}{2}e^{-x^2} * (-2x) = xe^{-x^2}
    \end{align}
    $$

8.  Primitive of $sin(x^2)$

    Again, much time spent. None of the above.

9.  Primitive of $(2x+1)e^{2x}$

    Differentiating first answer with product rule and chain rule gives:

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx}\left(xe^{2x} + 1\right) = x\frac{d}{dx}e^{2x} + e^{2x}\frac{d}{dx}x = 2xe^{2x} + e^{2x} = (2x+1)e^{2x}
    $$

10. Primitive of $\frac{2x}{x^2+1}$

    Differentiating second with chain rule:

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx}ln(x^2+1) = \frac{1}{x^2+1}*2x = \frac{2x}{x^2+1}
    $$

11. Plutonium 239 sample emits particles at a rate of $N(t) = N_0 * 2^{-\frac{t}{h}}$ particles/second, where $h = 7.6*10^{11}$ and $N_0 = 7.3*10^{11}$. Calculate $\int_{t=0}^{t=2*h} N(t)$.

12. Evaluate $\int_0^3f(x)dx$, where $f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & x < 2, \\[2.5mm] (x-1)^3 & x \geq 2 \end{cases}$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_0^2 2x + \int_2^3(x-1)^3 
    &= \left[ x^2 \right]_0^2 + \int_2^3(x-1)(x-1)(x-1) \\
    &= \left[ x^2 \right]_0^2 + \int_2^3 x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1 \\
    &= \left[ x^2 \right]_0^2 + \left[ \frac{1}{4}x^4 - x^3 + \frac{3}{2}x^2 - x\right]_2^3 \\
    \end{align}
    $$

    Evaluate:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \left(2^2 - 0^2\right) 
    &+ \left(\left( \frac{1}{4}3^4 - 3^3 + \frac{3}{2}3^2 - 3 \right)
    - \left( \frac{1}{4}2^4 - 2^3 + \frac{3}{2}2^2 - 2 \right)\right) \\
    &= 4 + ((20.25-27+13.5-3) - (4-8+6-2)) \\
    &= 4 + 3.75 + 0 \\
    &= 7.75
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    data.frame(x=seq(0,3,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y = ifelse(x < 2, 2*x, (x-1)^3)))
    ```

    Made two mistakes with my first try (of two!) First, I ignored $-1$, or rather differentiated. Second, programmatically I had `ifelse (x < 2)`. (I still find it counter-intuitive that the middle boundary is used for both integrals/primitives!)

13. Evaluate $\int_2^5 |3-x|dx$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_2^5 |3-x|dx &= \int_2^3 3-x + \int_3^5 x-3 \\
    &= \left[ 3x - \frac{1}{2}x^2 \right]_2^3 + \left[ \frac{1}{2}x^2 - 3x \right]_3^5 \\
    &= \left((9-4.5) - (6-2)\right) + \left((12.5 - 15) - (4.5-9)\right)
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    data.frame(x = seq(2,5,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y=abs(3-x)))
    ```

14. Evaluate $\int_2^5 |3-x|^2$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int_2^5 |3-x|^2dx &= \int_2^3 (3-x)^2 + \int_3^5 (x-3)^2 \\
    &= \int_2^3 9 -6x + x^2 + \int_3^5 x^2 -6x + 9 \\
    &= \left[ \frac{1}{3}x^3 -3x^2 + 9x \right]_2^5 \\\\
    \left( \frac{1}{3}5^3 - 3*5^2 + 9*5\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3}2^3 - 3*2^2 + 9*2\right) \\
    &= \left(\frac{125}{3} - 75 + 45\right) - \left(\frac{8}{3} - 12 + 18\right) \\
    &= 3
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    F <- function(x) { (1/3)*x^3 - 3*x^2 + 9*x }
    F(5)-F(2)
    ```

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    data.frame(x = seq(2,5,.01)) |> ggplot(aes(x)) + geom_line(aes(y=abs(3-x)^2))
    ```

15. Consider $\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}(sin(x))^4cos(x)dx$. Use $u=sin(x)$ for substitution in the form $\int_a^bf(u)du$. What are $a$, $b$ and $f(u)$?

    Argh, I was fully right on this one but went too far - should have submitted the penultimate line below:

    $$
    \begin{align}
    u &= sin(x) \\
    &\Rightarrow sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}) = -1\\
    &\Rightarrow sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= cos(x) \\
    du &= cos(x)dx \\\\
    \int (sin(x))^4cos(x)dx &= \int_{-1}^1 u^4du \\
    &= \left[ \frac{1}{5}u^5 \right]_{-1}^1
    \end{align}
    $$

16. Find primitive for $\int \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{4+x^4}}dx$ such that $F(0) = 1$.

    I could not get this one, via parts or substitution; and following online there were some unexplained jumps.

    Answer and explanation:

    $\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{4+x^4}$

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{4+x^4}}dx \\
    u &= 4+x^4 \\
    \frac{du}{dx} &= 4x^3 \\
    du &= 4x^3dx \\
    \frac{1}{4}du &= x^3dx \\\\
    \int \frac{1}{4u}du &= \int \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \Leftarrow \text{ Added this...} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} * 2\sqrt{u} \Leftarrow \text{ ...and this} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{u} \Leftarrow \text{ ...to understand this } \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{4+x^4}
    \end{align}
    $$

    Actually I was very close with substitution, but chose $u = \sqrt{4+x^4}$; and as noted, could not see how to finish it.

17. Find primitive for $\int x^4 ln(x)dx$ such that $F(1) = -\frac{1}{25}$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int x^4 ln(x) dx \\\\
    f &= x^4 \\
    F &= \frac{1}{5}x^5 \\
    g &= ln(x) \\
    g' &= \frac{1}{x} \\\\
    Fg - \int Fg'dx &= \frac{1}{5}x^5ln(x) - \int \frac{1}{5}x^5\frac{1}{x} \\
    &= \frac{1}{5}x^5ln(x) - \frac{1}{5}\frac{1}{5}x^5 \\
    &= \frac{1}{5}x^5ln(x) - \frac{1}{25}x^5
    \end{align}
    $$

18. Find primitive for $\int x^2e^x dx$ such that $F(0) = 2$.

    First took $F$ of $x^2$ and that seemed interminable so I switched parts. Then, I did make one mistake; lost a double-negative for the second integral, by not wrapping it prior to integration by parts - and ended up with $-2e^x + 4$.

    $$
    \begin{align}
    \int x^2e^xdx \\\\
    f &= e^x \\
    F &= e^x \\
    g &= x^2 \\
    g' &= 2x \\\\
    Fg - \int Fg' &= e^x x^2 - \int e^x 2x \\\\
    f_2 &= e^x \\
    F_2 &= e^x \\
    g_2 &= 2x \\
    g_2' &= 2 \\
    &= e^x x^2 - \left(e^x 2x - \int 2e^x\right) \\
    &= e^x x^2 - \left(e^x2x - 2 \int e^x\right) \\
    &= e^x x^2 - \left(e^x2x - 2e^x\right) \\
    &= e^x(x^2 - 2x + 2)
    \end{align}
    $$

    ```{r}
    F <- function(x) { exp(1)^x * ( x^2 - 2*x + 2)}
    F(0)
    ```
